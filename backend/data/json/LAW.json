In a hypothetical criminal case in state court, students draw on the useful facts from the record, synthesize rules from cases, and analogize and distinguish cases in a closed universe. Students receive feedback from the instructor on multiple drafts before submission. Students then submit one persuasive brief on a motion in the conventions of the Bluebook.  This course depends on participation; attendance is mandatory. Grading reflects written work, class preparedness and participation, and professionalism. This course is part of the required first-year JD curriculum.",

Students submit and orally argue one persuasive brief on a motion in federal district court. Students build on their writing and oral advocacy skills with more emphasis on the lawyering practice. Students lead strategy sessions, conduct legal writing by email, meet and confer with opposing counsel, research, bluebook, peer edit, moot, judge, and orally argue a motion.  This course depends on participation; attendance is mandatory. Spring grading reflects all non-written aspects of the work, including research, strategy, peer review, moots, and oral argument (including your roles as a judge and colleague), and professionalism. This course is open to first-year JD students only.",

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is rooted in the idea that shareholder value is not the only measure of a firm's value and, indeed, that the exclusive pursuit of profits may produce social harms.  The seminar will consider a variety of legal issues related to CSR, including: 1.  The meaning and measure of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria for corporations.  2.  The voluntary or mandatory disclosure of a company's environmental and social harms or risks.  3.  When is it legally and ethically appropriate for corporate managers or institutional investors to compromise shareholder value in the pursuit of social and environment goals?  4.  Constituency statutes and benefit corporations that reflect interests other than profit maximization.  5.  The power of investors to influence corporate behavior through capital allocation-investments (including impact investing) and divestments-and shareholder activism.  6.

        "title": "Discussion (1L):  Dress Codes: Race, Identity and Personal Appearance",
        "description": "Dress Codes may seem a bit old fashioned, but in fact we are constantly told who should wear what and when. Rules---written and implied---divide formal from casual attire and children's clothing from that of adults. There are rules for what to wear in each season of the year and rules about the right attire for different times of the day. And, of course, there are rules about the types of clothing men may wear and about the clothing suitable for women. Adherence to such rules is considered by many to be an important signal of breeding and even character: accordingly, immediate social sanctions---and indirect professional consequences---can follow from breaking them. Some dress codes are job requirements or house rules of an organization or establishment---flouting them can get one fired, kicked out of school or barred from a restaurant. Finally, there are laws about clothing, enforced by police or government officials. Break these rules and you may find yourself facing a fine or even a jail sentence. Why is attire so rule bound? Why and when is clothing important enough to become the subject of written treatises, rules and regulations, legislative proclamations and judicial edicts? This seminar will explore dress codes, from the sumptuary laws of the late Middle Ages to the unstated norms of the 21st century, and discover what they can tell us about the significance of clothing---our most conspicuous medium of self-expression---and its relationship to individual identity, community cohesiveness and social order.

Legal institutions incentivize innovation and allocate access to knowledge goods through a variety of mechanisms, including intellectual property, direct funding through grants and national laboratories, tax incentives, and innovation inducement prizes. In this discussion group, we will examine how these bodies of law are used both to reinforce and subvert existing power structures and inequalities, including issues related to gender, race, geography, and income. We will discuss inequalities among innovators as well as inequalities in access to new innovations, or in who those innovations are made for. We will also consider how these issues might be addressed through legal reforms either internal or external to innovation laws.  This discussion seminar will meet four times during the Fall quarter.

        "description": "In this discussion seminar, we will explore the intersection of access to information and access to justice.  Our current social and technological moment promises increased access to basic legal information without economic or geographic boundaries.  But access and accessibility remain influenced by identity, privilege, and power.  What are our collective expectations for governments to provide legal information in the digital age?  How does access to free, easy-to-use, reliable legal information -- or the lack thereof -- have an impact on low-income and other marginalized communities, particularly in how they exercise their rights and protect themselves from harm?  By examining how some of the most vulnerable populations access legal information, we can better assess the concept of open government with an eye toward informing and improving access to justice efforts.  Topics to be explored through readings and discussion include: 1) the adequacy of pro se litigants' access to legal information within the American prison system; 2) measuring the impact of U.S. states and municipalities that contract with private companies to publish public laws; 3) ways in which technology might help close the justice gap in low-income communities v. how technology can expose vulnerable communities to new forms of victimization; 4) creative and unique systems of information-sharing within the homeless population and how legal organizations might penetrate those systems to combat disenfranchisement of the homeless and provide them with broader access to legal services; and 5) the fragility of freedom of information laws in democracies and whether these laws contribute to a more informed public.

As a defining force for so many across the globe, and in the norms through which human beings recognize their rights and arrange their affairs, religion has a unique and abiding impact on the work and life of aspiring and practicing lawyers -- for believers and nonbelievers alike.  Whether as first-year law students or seasoned practitioners, the need to anticipate, appreciate, and reconcile religious perspectives is both a vital professional skill and an illuminating resource for self-understanding and mutual respect.  The class will meet across three on-campus sessions and a closing offsite dinner, and will include a collaborative exploration of primary and secondary sources, as well as custom conversational frameworks.  Topics will include religion and cross-cultural lawyering, religion and legal systems, the role of faith in judicial decision-making, and law as a vocation (with attendant self-care dynamics).  Befitting the overarching goals of diversity and inclusion in the discussion series generally, and the central importance of particularized themes of bridge building, this seminar is warmly and equally open to students of any religious tradition and those of no religion at all.

Emily is a Stanford Law graduate and former public defender, and as Co-Founder and Executive Director of Partners for Justice, she is the creator of the collaborative defense school of practice, which incorporates client-led and holistic defense principles into the everyday practice of law. She is currently working with jurisdictions around the nation to expand and re-define public defense.  Participants may also include, depending on their availability, George Gascon, the recently elected progressive District Attorney in Los Angeles who has been a leader in the investigation of racism in enforcement of the laws, Mike Romano, who leads our Three Strikes Project, and one of the Three Strikers whose release was secured by Stanford's Three Strike Project.

We will conclude by examining the most significant change within law schools over the past century, the rise of clinical legal education, reading parts of the Carnegie Report on Legal Education and Sam Moyn's recent critique of clinical education as well as a range of responses to his piece. Throughout the seminar, we will pay attention to the historical and social contexts out of which proposals for changing legal education arose as well as to how we might assess the contemporary structure of legal education in light of its history.

        "description": "Reasonable people sometimes disagree. How can reflective individuals hope to evaluate those disagreements? Fundamental notions of justice and rationality seem to dominate particular traditions in different places and different times. How can a twenty-first century product of American or other cultures decide which of various compelling ideas of justice and rationality is most persuasive to us? How can anyone escape the accidents of birth and tribal worldview? We will approach these questions through Alastair MacIntyre's provocative book of that name: Whose Justice? Which Rationality? (Univ. Of Notre Dame Press 1988). Whether or not MacIntyre&iquest;s neo-Aristotelian approach to the fundamental questions of ethical theory ultimately prove persuasive, his attempt to find alternatives to the utilitarian and Kantian relics of the Enlightenment will, I hope, open a conversation about what we believe and why.

We will examine 20th century resistance to the forms of historical consciousness embedded in the architecture of these public spaces, 21st century movements to remove and replace this architecture and associated cultural representations of white supremacy, as well as  longstanding debates in this and other cultures about how atrocities are remembered, and the socio-legal aspects of holding perpetrators to account.

        "description": "People like to think of technology as value neutral, as essentially objective tools that can be used for good or evil, particularly when questions of race and racial justice are involved. But the technologies we develop and deploy are frequently shaped by historical prejudices, biases, and inequalities and thus may be no less biased and racist than the underlying society in which they exist. In this discussion group, we will consider whether and how racial and other biases are present in a wide range of technologies, particularly artificial intelligence tools like risk assessment algorithms for bail, sentencing, predictive policing, and other decisions in the criminal justice system; algorithms for medical diagnosis and treatment decisions; AI that screens tenant or credit applications or job applications; facial recognition systems; surveillance tools; and many more. Building on these various case studies, we will seek to articulate a framework for recognizing both explicit and subtle anti-black and other biases in technology and understanding them in the broader context of racism and inequality in our society. Finally, we will discuss how these problems might be addressed, including by regulators, legislators, and courts as well as by significant changes in mindset and practical engagement by technology developers, companies, and educators.

        "description": "This seminar will focus on the abolitionist agenda for prisons and policing, and on the competing calls to reform those institutions.  We will also consider the comparison case of the death penalty, where efforts at reform have often, but not always, been seen as stepping stones on the path toward abolition.  We will read arguments for and against abolition, and for and against reform.  Our main goal will not be to decide who we think is right, or which arguments we find most congenial.  Instead, we will try to understand the thinking on both sides of these debates, and to see what value, if any, we can find even in the arguments we disagree with.  We will also be asking whether the authors fairly characterize, and productively engage with, positions contrary to their own.  In other words, we will be studying the debates between abolitionists and reformers in criminal justice not just to learn something about prisons, policing, and the death penalty, but also to reflect on the possibilities and prerequisites for constructive discussion of contentious issues in a splintered society.

        "title": "Discussion (1L):  Reimagining Capitalism",
        "description": "Scholars' and policy makers' thinking about political economy evolves as one understanding of the role of government ceases to reflect people's aspirations and views of social reality and is superseded by another. The laissez faire thinking of the 19th century was replaced by Keynesian management in response to the Great Depression. After WWII, Keynesian thinking was challenged, by 'neoliberalism'---a challenge that began to achieve success in the 1970s in response to perceived failures of government, high inflation, and other economic and social woes. By the mid-1980s, neoliberalism had become the new conventional wisdom, and liberals as well as conservatives accepted its core premises: that society consists of atomized individuals competing rationally to advance their own interests; that this behavior, in aggregate, produces good social outcomes and economic growth; that free markets are therefore the best way to allocate societal resources and government should intervene only to remedy market failures. Disagreements about what constitutes such failures and about corrective interventions persisted, but the general premises were widely embraced by policymakers and politicians. Today, that consensus is breaking down. Neoliberal policies and the particular systems of capitalism that accompany them have generated profound wealth inequality and have little to offer to address the perceived threats of globalization, climate change, and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics. The coronavirus pandemic has only served to highlight these and other problems.But what should come next?  Our readings in the course will explore a variety of themes related to these issues. How did neoliberalism come to dominate political discourse? What are its core tenets? What kinds of challenges are being presented to them, and what might alternative approaches to political economy for the 21st century look like?

        "title": "Discussion (1L):  Tort Encounters",
        "description": "Lawsuits for compensation for personal injury often provide lay people with their first -- or even only -- interaction with the civil side of courts. Those interactions are rarely wholly happy, raising fundamental issues for plaintiffs about the definition of just desserts and fair procedure. There is a rich literature on these personal encounters, some autobiographical and others written by journalists who were given permission to closely follow victims' efforts to obtain compensation. These accounts paint a different picture of the tort liability regime than the one which 1Ls usually encounter in their Fall Torts course, which in recent decades have foregrounded a &quot;law &amp; economics&quot; perspective that focuses on deterring defendants rather than on satisfying victims' desires for justice. In each session we will read a book about an individual's or family's personal encounter with tort law. Candidate books for discussion include an autobiographical take on the author's experience suing doctors for malpractice after her husband's untimely death, a journalist's close account of a working class family's pursuit of compensation for the death of their infants, a holocaust victim's response to the outcome of a class action against Swiss Banks, a journalist's account of a community seeking compensation and accountability for toxic exposure from a pharmaceutical facility. We'll each read the selected book for the session and discuss what the account tells us about the operation of tort law (and civil procedure) in real life and what potential legal reforms it suggests, if any. Each session will be led by one or two students who volunteer (at the beginning of the quarter) to start off and guide the discussion. Writing requirement: One short (5 or so pages) reflection paper on one of the assigned books or another related book of your choice. If you choose to reflect on a different book, it should also be an account of laypersons' experiences with the tort liability system (not a doctrinal analysis of tort law).

A central object of focus will be excessive force, the legal doctrines that insulate government officers from accountability, and the ways this specific form of violence is tied to racial subordination.  We will also attend to the role of force in non-violent resistance movements, the role of vulnerability in resistance movements (both revolutionary and reform-oriented), and problems of revictimization in rights assertion.

        "title": "Discussion (1L):  Why is the USA Exceptional -- In Crime and Punishment?",
        "description": "It has long been a national controversy, and for many an international embarrassment, that the imprisonment rate in this country stands at the very top among nations -- currently just barely behind those of countries we would never want to be compared to and several multiples higher than those of other developed industrialized democracies.  And for many years it has been almost a clich&eacute; that we also have an internationally anomalously high crime rate.  The crime gap between us and our &quot;peer nations&quot; has narrowed in recent years but is still notable, at least for violent crime.  In the seminar we will read an interdisciplinary set of explorations about whether there are things in &quot;national DNA&quot;  that explain each of these phenomena and possibly both at once.  The perspectives will include the political history of our roots in both revolution and slavery and the legacy of Reconstruction, and cultural/anthropological theories about the &quot;frontier mentality,&quot; as well as such distinct factors as our anomalous rate of gun ownership.  Along all these dimensions we will speculate on which way the causation runs between crime or punishment and these various correlates.  But of course we will also look to the legal system, including our rights- and federalism-focused Constitution, as both cause and effect of our anomalies.  While we will look at some more quantitively empirical perspectives, especially as they bear on recent changes in both crime and punishment rates, our main subject will be more of an &quot;American Studies&quot; approach to the overall stability of how we compare to other nations.

        "title": "Discussion (1L): Asian Americans Justice Struggles",
        "description": "Over the past eighteen months, coronavirus-related racism and anti-Asian hate violence have renewed perennial conversations about Asian American identity and advocacy in the United States.  What does it mean to be Asian American?  What is and has been the place of Asian Americans in broader social movements for racial justice?  And what can the historical experiences of Asian Americans in resisting injustice teach us about Asian American activism, legal advocacy, and political struggles today?  This seminar will explore these questions, among others, through reading and conversation around four key timeframes: 1) the Chinese Exclusion era of the late nineteenth century, which initiated decades of Asian immigrant exclusion but also spawned surprising legal resistance by early migrants; 2) the 1960s and 1970s, in which Asian America was created as a political project in tandem with Black and Third World liberation movements; 3) the post-9/11 period, where segments of the Asian American community confronted the recurrent framing of Asian Americans as security threats during the war on terror and beyond; and 4) the present moment, in which Asian Americans make and contest their place within multiracial movements addressing a host of pressing contemporary challenges.  Throughout, this seminar will make visible the role and struggles of Asian Americans, broadly defined, in U.S. law, history, and social movements.

        "description": "The principle that corporate managers' sole duty is to maximize shareholders' financial value has never been entirely adhered to in practice and has been increasingly challenged in recent decades. While acknowledging the importance of shareholder value, commentators have argued that corporations should purposively benefit other stakeholders, including customers, employees, and the communities they affect. At the same time, there has been an upswing of investments aligned with investors' social interests, including public equity investments in companies with high environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings and private equity &quot;impact investments&quot; that arguably incur greater risks than pure market rate investments.  Our seminar will consider a variety of legal, ethical, and policy issues related to corporations' purposes and responsibilities, including when is it legally and ethically appropriate for corporate managers or institutional investors to compromise shareholder value in the pursuit of social, environmental and other non-pecuniary goals; corporate governance structures that reflect interests other than profit maximization; the power of investors to influence corporate behavior through affirmative investments, divestments and shareholder activism; and the power of various stakeholder groups to influence corporate behavior.

        "description": "This discussion seminar will deal with the relationship between criminal justice and American society, at various points in American history.  The emphasis will not be on doctrines of criminal law, or case-law in general, but on the living law, and the ways in which criminal justice arose out of and reflected social norms and the structure of society.  Among the topics to be covered:  First, a look at criminal justice in the early colonial period, asking what was distinctive about crime and punishment in the small communities of the 17th and 18th centuries.  Second, the intimate connection between race and criminal justice, from slavery through the Jim Crow era.  Third:  corrections and law enforcement -- the penitentiary, police and detective squads, the reform wave in the late 19th century, and what all of these reveal about the nature of American criminality; and the public reaction to crime and punishment.  We will also consider informal justice, including the vigilante movement in the American West.  Lastly, we want to examine the rise and fall of victimless crime.  A strong anti-vice movement in the late 19th century movement led to the Mann Act, red-light abatement, the criminalization of abortion, and controls over sexual behavior in general.  The movement culminated in the &quot;noble experiment&quot; of national Prohibition.  This was the rise:  the fall was first, the end of Prohibition, then the decriminalization of most forms of victimless crimes in the later 20th century.

        "description": "When you first encounter civil procedure in the fall quarter, it may seem dry and technical.  With so much to learn so fast there isn't always time to talk about the political dimension of the rules.  Simply put, the rules determine who gets access to court, for what types of claims, with what sorts of potential outcomes.  In short, civil procedure rules have huge distributional consequences.  Not surprisingly, then, the rule drafting process is dominated by interest group politics and in recent decades, key U.S. Supreme Court decisions on civil procedure have been shaped by the justices' ideological preferences.  In this group we will read and discuss four topics that foreground the politics of procedure: 1. The rulemaking process.  Who are the rule-makers?  How are the rule-makers chosen, by whom?  How does the rulemaking process work?; 2. The consequences of pleading standards and why they have become stricter over time; 3. The battles over discovery rules and why they matter; and 4. The politics of class action reform.  Prior to each session, you will email me a 1-page reflections paper identifying the issues in the readings that you would like us to discuss.  After the conclusion of the quarter, you will submit a 3-5 page paper reflecting on the political dimension of procedure with reference to the procedural issues we have discussed or others of your choosing.  Elements used in grading:  Full attendance, reading of assigned materials, and active participation.  The seminar will meet four times during the Fall quarter.  The class will meet (TBA).",

        "description": "Decades of cuts to local government have wreaked havoc on communities left behind by the modern economy.  Some of these discarded places are rural, others are urban.  Some are conservative, some are progressive.  Some are the most diverse communities in America, others are segregated.  All are routinely trashed by outsiders for their poverty and their politics.  Mostly, their governments are just broke.  When a high-poverty city or county has run out of services to cut, properties to sell, bills to defer, and risky loans to take, what should its elected leaders do to ameliorate the harms of concentrated poverty?  In this discussion group, students will engage readings, documentaries, and visual media about these topics.  Each session, they will read one place-based chapter from Professor Anderson's forthcoming book, The Fight to Save the Town, which focuses on local networks of leaders and residents who are facing these challenges.  Students will leave the course with a richer sense of the lived experience of poverty and its governance, as well as a broader picture of &quot;law&quot; that includes local administrative proceedings, municipal codes, civil and criminal law enforcement practices, elected public leadership, state and local taxation, and local budgets.

As lawyers, we commit to representing clients in an array of formal and informal processes, over discrete violations of law as well as long-ranging breaches of social norms, in local, state and international jurisdictions, in-person and on-line. In this seminar, we will examine different kinds of conflict and different kinds of processes, who designs those processes and who selects the specific process to use in a given instance. Examples include a corporate general counsel's management of consumer disputes; process options for Stanford students facing disputes with the University, other students, faculty, or staff; initiatives to address racial inequity and injustice through San Francisco's African American Reparations Advisory Committee of the San Francisco Human Rights Commission; and the role of technology as a source of disputes as well as means to facilitate resolution.

        "description": "In 2022, the Supreme Court will hear a blockbuster case, Brackeen v. Haaland, that raises numerous constitutional questions that go to the very heart of federal Indian Law. Are American Indians a race, a political group, or both? How much power does Congress have over the States where the State is involved in the lives of American Indian people? Etc. The case is a challenge to a federal law, the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), that was passed in response to federal and state government laws and policies which led to the forced removal of countless Indian children from their families. Much like the laws that led to ICWA, Brackeen, is about more than Indian children, though Indian children are caught in the crossfire of this fight. This discussion seminar focuses on these legal questions of state power and sovereignty and how they ended up being so intertwined with child welfare, beginning with the history leading up to ICWA, moving forward through development of contemporary tribal governments and ending with this current case.

        "description": "This seminar explores the concept of equality of educational opportunity, how law and policy have structured inequality in schools, and the efforts to dismantle inequality and promote equal educational opportunity. We will first consider the concept of equality of educational opportunity. What does it mean to provide equal opportunity and how should educational resources be distributed in a just and fair manner? With that framing, we will consider three specific areas of educational inequality and how law and policy have both structured and can remedy those inequalities. First, we'll explore racial inequality from segregation to tracking to school discipline practices. Beyond historical de jure segregation, how do contemporary school policies structure racial inequality and how can those structures be dismantled? Second, we will consider educational finance policies and the litigation campaigns that have aimed to ensure that our schools are adequately funded and educational resources are distributed equitably. We'll ask the questions of when and how does money matter and what does it mean to provide an adequate education? Finally, we will wade into the ideologically charged, conceptually complex, and empirically murky area of school choice. Can school choice policies such as charter schools, educational vouchers, and inter-district choice promote equity or are they simply doomed to exacerbate our existing inequalities?

        "description": "Litigation is supposed to be a search for truth, and this search is especially important in criminal law, where outcomes involve the maximum power of the state against the individual, and the consequences of error seem intolerable. But how does criminal law determine the &quot;truth&quot;? Does criminal adjudication represent an epistemological system -- a system for producing knowledge? Or is it something else entirely? This set of issues necessarily implicates a wide variety of legal doctrines that you will be exploring throughout your legal education, but in this short course we will sample provocative excerpts from case law, jurisprudence, social science, and history to address several questions.  First, what are the procedural standards of proof that determine the kind of truth criminal justice demands? How much more important is it to avoid wrongful conviction of innocent persons than to convict the guilty? Can statistical evidence alone ever be enough to establish guilt? And how do legal &quot;presumptions&quot; affect our determinations of the &quot;facts&quot; of a case?  Second, does the criminal justice system address the many ways that witnesses, even when confident and morally honest, get the truth wrong? For example, eyewitness identifications are highly persuasive evidence -- but DNA exonerations and social science research reveal they are frequently unreliable and incorrect. How does/should the system mitigate this problem? Why does the public view seem to view &quot;direct evidence&quot; as more persuasive than &quot;merely&quot; circumstantial evidence? What does social science research tell us about the phenomenon of people falsely confessing to crimes? How confident are we in the forensic &quot;science&quot; testimony that expert witnesses may offer?  Third, in what way is the &quot;truth&quot; as determined by our criminal justice system shaped and sculpted by the government? Does the system do anything to mitigate the natural effects of &quot;tunnel vision&quot; -- or does it instead exacerbate it by aiming for satisfying narrative coherence at the risk of falsehood? Does the Miranda rule obviate coerced confessions? Why are police officers allowed to lie to suspects? Should prosecutors be allowed to offer a person leniency in exchange for testimony against others? Finally, how good are American juries at truth-finding, and does our system have any controls in place for correcting factual error? Can jurors accurately detect deception in witnesses? What types of biases might afflict honest jurors and how can the law deal with them? Does our system have adequate ways of correcting factual errors after an adjudication? How should that goal be balanced with an interest in finality and other values?  Class meets 6:00 PM-8:00 PM on Sept. 28, Oct. 12, Oct. 26, Nov. 9.",

        "title": "Discussion (1L): Rationalism, Contrarianism, and Bayesian Thinking in Politics: How to Think Better?",
        "description": "In the early 2010s, the Bay Area spawned a movement of thinkers obsessed with cognitive biases and &quot;Bayesian reasoning,&quot; a way of using statistics and probability to inform beliefs. This group--that later came to be known as &quot;rationalists&quot;--insists on subjecting all spheres of life to scientific scrutiny and probabilistic reasoning. Rationalist takes are often contrarian and challenge mainstream ways of thinking about topics that include everything from science and medicine to philosophy and politics to the rise of artificial intelligence. Rationalist writings in blogs and books can be controversial. For example, some rationalists have discussed the genetics of depression or intelligence. Since 2015, however, rationalism has become a brand in Silicon Valley and hugely influential among pundits and executives. Members of the rationalist movement also overlapped with the growing community of &quot;effective altruism,&quot; an effort to remake charity donations by focusing on, and calculating, the actual impact of every dollar on human lives.  And the movement is full of quirks and, well, weirdness: a fear of AI armaggedon, polyamory, and group living near Berkeley is common. Politically, rationalists are mostly center-left, but they range from  &quot;communist to anarcho-capitalist.&quot; What brings them together, however, is that they are careful thinkers, quantitatively-oriented, and contrarians.  In this seminar we will explore what the Rationalist movement is all about--what and how they think. We will take both a critical but also inquisitive view. What is to be gained from rationalists? Can their way of thinking improve political debates? We will read several books, including James Scott's &quot;Seeing like a State,&quot; Julia Galef's &quot;Scout Mindset,&quot; Philip Tetlock's &quot;Superforcasters,&quot; blog posts from a website called &quot;Less Wrong,&quot; and a series of blog-posts by the psychiatrist-cum-polymath Scott Alexander on drug arrests, crime spikes, and medical regulations, among others.

        "description": "This seminar will explore how to accommodate efforts to promote inclusion and belonging for students with diverse identities and viewpoints and academic freedom and freedom of expression.  We will test the hypothesis that it is possible to serve these important interests without compromising any of them.  Our substantive goal is to contribute to the solution of actual contemporary problems in American universities.  Our procedural goal is for the seminar to model productive critical discourse about difficult issues.  Needless to say, the seminar will address controversial topics involving participants' identities and ideological beliefs, and calls for active listening, empathy, humility, and charity on everyone's part.  We will begin by examining the purpose of the university, the differences between faculty members' academic freedom and students' rights to free expression, and the limits of both. With respect to academic freedom, we'll consider proceedings by the University of Pennsylvania Law School to discipline a faculty member for &quot;intentional and incessant racist, sexist, xenophobic, and homophobic actions and statements.&quot;  One of the major reasons for protecting students' free expression is to create an environment in which they can engage in the core educational practices of critical inquiry and discourse. Critical discourse requires that students feel free to express ideas without fear of being ostracized.  We will ask how to create such an environment without infringing on faculty's academic freedom (e.g., by mandating trigger warnings) or students free expression (e.g., by mandating the Chatham House rule, which prohibits attributing statements made in class to particular students).  We will then address a selection of other issues, all with a problem-solving attitude: How can universities support the inclusion and participation of socially marginalized students and students with views across ideological and political spectrums in ways that avoid institutional orthodoxy and encourage open discourse?;  How can universities prevent and remedy harmful attacks on community members' identities and beliefs in ways that are consistent with academic freedom, free expression, privacy, and due process?; How, consistent with principles of academic freedom, can a university ascertain whether a candidate for promotion or for a faculty position will engage in behaviors that promote inclusion?

        "title": "Discussion (1L):  Legal Education in History: Conflicts Over Law and Its Teaching",
        "description": "This seminar explores debates over the nature and purposes of law and legal education in the United States from the late nineteenth century to the present--with a particular focus on the role of law schools in managing the line between law and politics.  We will begin by examining the formation of modern legal education at Harvard, exploring the turn to legal formalism and its interconnections with the rise of modern capitalism (including the emergence of the defense bar) and anti-immigrant sentiment (including the rise of the plaintiffs' bar).  The formalist approach--and its deployment by a conservative U.S. Supreme Court eager to strike down welfare legislation in the Progressive era--would in turn give rise to sociolegal jurisprudence and later legal realism.  Centered first and foremost at Columbia and Yale, these approaches would profoundly transform American law schools, all but definitively separating American legal education from its counterparts across the globe.  In the wake of the Second World War, as Americans increasingly turned to positivist social science and its promise of law beyond politics, American legal education embraced a new philosophy--that of the process school--which highlighted (American) institutions and procedure as the key to avoiding the pitfalls of both formalism and realism.  We will conclude by examining the current landscape of American legal education.  Even as the promise of the process school has faltered, the present-day American law school is indelibly marked by its history--including the case method (inherited from late nineteenth-century formalism), a realist commitment to studying law in action, and the process school&iquest;s obsession with (American) institutions and procedure (as exemplified by the study of federal courts).  At the same time, we see a turn to interdisciplinarity and to legal clinics--representing the polar extremes of law as science and law as professional practice.  But as the perennial question of the relationship between law and politics has become increasingly urgent in the present moment, what has become of the role of legal education in managing the line between law and politics--long the focal point of debates over law and its teaching?

        "description": "People generally come to law school because they believe that law and legal institutions matter.  Many think that the study of law will enable them to more effectively influence important social institutions. Some also come to law school hoping to use their law degrees to make the world better -- whatever that means to them. Contemporary left social movements offer a range of visions for what might make the world better, including (but certainly not limited to): abolishing police and prisons; developing a decarbonized economy; restructuring the economic order more generally; implementing systems for reparations and repair for racialized enslavement and dispossession; and opening borders.  These visions exist alongside other, sometimes competing, ideas for how to make the world better.  This seminar will interrogate the connection between law and hopeful visions for the future.  We will engage in some critique of existing institutions, and of the limits of law, but the focus of the conversation will be creative envisioning, not critique.  We'll explore the questions of whether and how it is possible to design legal frameworks that move toward more hopeful futures.  Class meets 4:30 PM-6:30 PM on Oct. 4, Oct. 18, Nov. 1, Nov. 15.

        "description": "Since America's founding, local political engagement (through participation, leadership, and organizing in local politics) has been a linchpin of our democratic order and adult education. That engagement is deeply challenged today by economic segregation, technological and media changes, the downsizing of local journalism, and the loss of institutions that forge local social networks (such as small businesses, churches, and neighborhood-based nonprofits). Yet meanwhile, poor and working class communities need local solutions and activism to face severe challenges such as environmental disasters, low wages, drug addiction, family dissolution, and disinvestment in basic services, schools, and infrastructure. This reading group will sit with stories and strategies of local democratic reengagement. Through a range of readings (from memoir to academic commentary) as well as films and podcasts, we'll discuss a deliberately diverse set of voices, from environmental justice activists to conservative thought leaders. We'll situate our discussions in a diverse set of urban and rural places, including California's agricultural interior, rural Alabama, Oregon's timber counties, post-industrial Massachusetts, and urban Mississippi. My hope is that our group of students--like the authors and protagonists of our discussions--will be racially, politically, economically, and geographically heterogeneous, allowing us to envision and teach each other to become better actors in the project of local political engagement for the public good.

        "title": "Discussion (1L):  Exit, Voice, and Loyalty for Lawyers",
        "description": "The eminent economist Albert O. Hirschman is especially famous for his book Exit, Voice, Loyalty (1970).  The subtitle of the book--Responses to Decline in Firms, Organizations, and States--may give you a little sense of the argument: that people who are dissatisfied with an institution to which they are attached have three choices.  They can leave (switch to another product; quit; emigrate); they can try to change the institution through protest; or they can remain a customer, member, or citizen who goes along with (and perhaps even continues to support) the institution's choices.  In this reading group, we will talk about how, as lawyers, we should think about these options. We'll start with a brief overview of Hirschman's argument and an essay by Hannah Arendt about lawyers and bureaucrats in Nazi Germany. We'll then look at some contemporary case studies involving U.S. lawyers who wrestled with whether to serve, or remain in, administrations with which they had serious disagreements and about law firms and their clients.  Finally, we'll turn to two examples from outside the law--Ursula LeGuin's famous short story The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas and a speech by C.S. Lewis about The Inner Circle--and what they tell us about how to think about our career choices.  Class meets 5:30 PM-7:30 PM on Sept. 13, Sept. 27, Oct. 17, Nov. 14.

In this seminar, you'll be reading them with a different question in mind: What makes one judicial opinion better than another?  What is it about certain opinions that leads them to be considered particularly effective or important?  When is a judicial opinion &quot;great&quot;? You will read a variety of opinions from different judges and justices, subject areas, perspectives, and time periods, as well as some academic articles about judicial opinions and legal writing. Spoilers: There is no one answer to the title of this seminar.  The goal will be to complicate the question and think about the different tools and objectives judges have when they write.

If a student seeks to continue or expand on work that the student initiated previously (whether for a course, clinic, externship, or otherwise) a student must (1) share the initial work with the professor supervising the directed research, to the extent that work is non-privileged, and (2) obtain permission for the expansion from the instructor or supervisor who supervised the initial project.  The final product must be embodied in a paper or other form of written work involving a substantial independent effort on the part of the student.  A student must submit a detailed petition of at least 250 words, approved by the sponsoring faculty member, outlining his or her proposed project and demonstrating that the research is likely to result in a significant scholarly contribution.  A student may petition for &quot;Directed Research: Curricular Development&quot; when the work involves assisting a Law School faculty member in developing concepts or materials for new and innovative law school courses. Both the supervising faculty member and the Associate Dean for Curriculum must approve petition for &quot;Directed Research: Curricular Development.&quot; Students must meet with the instructor frequently for the purposes of report and guidance. Unit credit is by arrangement. Students whose projects warrant more than four units should consider a Senior Thesis or the Research Track (See SLS Student Handbook for requirements and limitations).  With the approval of the instructor, successful completion of a directed research project of two units or more may satisfy the JD writing requirement to the extent of one research writing course (R course).

The thesis topic should be chosen no later than two weeks after the beginning of the seventh term of law study and may be chosen during the sixth term. The topic is subject to the approval of the thesis supervisor, who may be any member of the Law School faculty under whose direction the student wishes to write the thesis and who is willing to assume the responsibility therefor. An oral defense of the thesis before members of the faculty, including the thesis supervisor, will be conducted late in the student's ninth academic term. Acceptance of the thesis for credit requires the approval of the thesis supervisor and one or more other members of the faculty who will be selected by the supervisor. Satisfactory completion of the senior thesis will satisfy graduation requirements to the extent of (a) 5 - 8 units of credit and (b) two research courses. The exact requirements for a senior thesis are in the discretion of the supervising faculty member. Special Instructions: Two Research credits are possible.

Only projects supervised by a member of the faculty (tenured, tenure-track, senior lecturer, or professor from practice) may qualify for Directed Professional Writing credit.  It will not necessarily be appropriate to require each member of the team to write the number of pages that would be required for an individual directed research project earning the number of units that each team member will earn for the team project.  The page length guidelines applicable to individual papers may be considered in determining the appropriate page length, but the faculty supervisor has discretion to make the final page-length determination.  Students must meet with the instructor frequently for the purposes of report and guidance. Unit credit is by arrangement.  A petition will not be approved for work assigned or performed in a course, clinic, or externship for which the student has or will receive credit.  Directed Professional Writing petitions are available on the Law School Registrar's Office website (see Forms and Petitions).  Elements used in grading:  As agreed to by instructor.",

This Practicum aims to develop principles for INTERPOL to guide its interpretation and application of Article 3 to capture this new--online--manifestation of transnational crime. More specifically, it aims to establish general guidelines that INTERPOL can rely on in determining whether a request to process information on offenses arguably implicating freedom of expression online is in alignment with its constitutional obligation to remain neutral and adhere to international human rights standards.  This Practicum is open to graduate students from law (2L, 3L, and Advanced Degree), business, international policy, communications, computer science, and other relevant programs.

        "description": "Clients: Stanford Election Law Project &lt;https://law.stanford.edu/stanford-university-election-law-project/&gt; and the Stanford PACS Program on Democracy and the Internet &lt;https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/research/program-on-democracy-and-the-internet/projects/&gt;.  California recently passed SB 759, the &quot;Every Vote Counts Act,&quot; to codify requirements allowing voters a chance to fix their ballot in case of a signature mismatch. SB 759 requires elections officials notify voters of mismatched signatures at least 8 days prior to the certification of an election. Ballots would be counted by elections officials if a signature verification statement is returned no later than 5:00 p.m. two days prior to certification. However, the law does not specify in great detail the steps that counties should take to contact voters. Prior to the bill's passage, a report by the California Voter Foundation revealed substantial variation in how counties verified mismatched signatures and contacted affected voters. This Policy Lab research project will produce the first public report tracking how counties have implemented/are planning to implement the requirements of SB 759. This project maps how the implementation of state statutes and guidelines dealing with vote-by-mail signature verification varies among California counties. Research questions for each county include: (1) What criteria does a signature need to meet to &quot;not appear to be the same&quot; (and therefore result in a ballot being invalidated)? (2) What remedial steps are taken, with regards to SB 759, if an election worker determines there is a &quot;signature mismatch&quot; before the statutory deadline? To answer these questions, students will conduct a survey of county election officials and administrative material and produce a final report with findings and lessons to improve county procedures. Students will research legal and policy frameworks, interview policy makers and state administrative officials, develop targeted policy recommendations, and brief policy makers on recommendations. The final report will be publicly available and will inform California county election officials, state policy-makers, and voting rights advocacy groups.  This policy practicum is offered for two to three variable units.  Students may elect three units by special arrangement with the instructors.

        "description": "Client: Steyer-Taylor Center for Climate Energy and Finance.  This is the winter quarter continuation of this practicum. We take as a given the well-established scientific evidence establishing the causal connection between greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and global warming, and the likelihood that current trajectories of fossil fuel use are leading to catastrophic climate change. In addition to its global consequences, climate change threatens to compromise Stanford's core missions through fires, environmental damage, and other harms to the University's staff, students, and faculty.  In the Autumn Quarter, in which the practicum was co-taught by Alicia Seiger, students undertook several research projects, including how Stanford researchers' broad-ranging expertise in energy-related finance issues could be most effectively deployed to inform policy makers; reducing food waste as a means of reducing GHG emissions; and Stanford health services' role in reducing GHG emissions.  In the Winter Quarter, we will focus on the possible effects on GHG emissions of investment policies and practices, automobile and air transportation, and the consumption of beef and other foods.  The mandate of Stanford Law and Policy Labs is to conduct impartial, evidence-informed policy analysis. Rather than deliver a set of specific recommendations, this practicum seeks to assess the pros and cons of plausible policies. While participants may have prior views on some of the issues, they should be open to revising their views in light of the evidence. Policy Lab practicums are research seminars. Although we will assign some readings and invite experts to meet with the seminar during the quarter, much of the research will be conducted by student teams. Policy Lab practicums are designed primarily for law students, but are open to students throughout the University. This practicum seeks students with knowledge of economics, finance, food systems, and environmental science. Admission is by petition.

        "title": "Policy Practicum:  Donor Advised Funds and Their Critics",
        "description": "The donor advised fund (DAF) is an increasingly popular vehicle for charitable giving. Donors receive a tax deduction when they contribute money or appreciated assets to a DAF; at their discretion, donors (DAF &quot;holders&quot;) may advise the DAF manager, or &quot;sponsor,&quot; to distribute funds to tax-exempt charities. There are about 500,000 individual DAFs across the country, with total assets of over $100 billion. The major DAF sponsors are community foundations and the charitable arms of investment managers like Schwab, Fidelity, and Vanguard. Although donors can only &quot;advise&quot; rather than &quot;direct&quot; a sponsor to make a gift, their advice is almost always heeded.  DAFs arguably incentivize giving by providing a vehicle for donating complex assets and reducing a donor's burdens by offloading administrative tasks to the DAF sponsor. Some DAF sponsors also offer advice to enable their DAF holders to give more effectively.  Yet DAFs have been criticized on several grounds, and legislation has been introduced (but not enacted) to regulate them. One criticism is that while donors receive the tax deduction immediately upon contributing to a DAF, they can take as long as they wish to make gifts from the DAF, and even pass advisory authority on to their heirs, thus delaying putting the funds into the hands of charities that can use them.  (In comparison, foundations are required to spend at least 5 percent of their assets annually.) Another criticism is that gifts made through a DAF can be anonymous, with only the DAF sponsor listed as the donor. (In comparison, gifts and grants by foundations must be reported on publicly available tax returns.) In addition, some DAF sponsors have concerns about requests to make gifts to putative hate groups: how to determine whether an organization falls in this category, and how to respond to the request if it does. At a time when the controversy around DAFs is only likely to grow, this Policy Lab practicum will provide an evidence-based analysis of the pros and cons of various self-reform and regulatory proposals. The research team will focus on understanding the perspectives of the recipients of DAF funding as well as those of DAF sponsors, DAF holders, regulators, and critics.

        "description": "Post-Ferguson Civil Rights Enforcement and Municipal Courts.  The Ferguson Report prepared by the United States Department of Justice identified a number of procedural due process violations in the way the city's municipal courts functioned.  These procedural defects amplified the consequences of racial disparities in who was arrested and charged in the city.  In the wake of the Ferguson Report, civil rights litigation has been brought challenging similar procedural due process violations in other municipal courts around the country.  Litigation has concentrated on excessive bail, fines, fees, and other court costs, conflicts of interests in having judges whose budgets depend on collection exercise discretion in setting these charges and collecting them, and failure to comply with Bearden v. Georgia (1983) (prohibiting imprisonment for failure to pay court charges without inquiring into a litigant's indigence and determining that a litigant's failure to pay is &quot;willful&quot;). This two-quarter sequence policy lab focuses on (i) gathering empirical, doctrinal, historical, and other research on municipal court practices associated with the setting, charging, and collection of court fines, fees, and other costs, including demographic research on vulnerable populations affected by procedural errors, (ii) gathering evidence regarding best practices to reform court procedures, particularly regarding compliance with Bearden v. Georgia, (iii) drafting initiatives for recommendation to the client, and (iv) closely editing and refining the proposals for distribution.

        "description": "Partner: Brennan Center for Justice.  Most states and the federal government have adopted laws enhancing penalties for hate crimes, but questions remain as to the effectiveness of these laws in deterring hate violence and making victims whole.  Some within marginalized and civil rights communities seek alternative---or additional---approaches that do more to address the communal injuries hate crimes inflict, without an exclusive focus on lengthening incarceration for offenders.  Yet many of these alternative models, including restorative justice approaches, are undertheorized, rare in practice, and insufficiently assessed.  In conjunction with the Brennan Center for Justice, this policy lab assesses alternative approaches to hate crimes in theory and practice.  Students will work in collaborative teams to analyze existing research in fields including criminal law and criminology, identify innovative hate crimes programs established by nonprofit organizations or local governments, review outcomes related to restorative justice models, and prepare for an expert convening in the Winter term. The project will conclude with a final report.  This policy lab is open to 4-6 students and will be graded on an H/P basis.  Students may take this policy lab for either 2 - 3 credits.

        "title": "Policy Practicum: Can Opening Up the Legal Services Market Increase Access to Justice?",
        "description": "The legal services market is in the middle of its most dramatic reexamination in decades.  Several states --- among them California, Arizona, Utah, and Florida --- are considering or already implementing changes to their Rules of Professional Conduct in order to expand who can provide legal services and how. These reforms are designed to accelerate innovation in the delivery of legal services and, ultimately, increase access to justice, in part by allowing technology and people without JDs to play a greater role than they can today. As states consider these reforms, questions have come to the fore as to how potential changes may impact potential clients, existing clients, and providers of legal services.  Significant questions include: Who are the nontraditional legal services providers most likely to seek to operate under the new rules? What are their delivery and business models? What kinds of consumers are they serving, and for what kinds of legal needs? What risks do they pose? With Utah and Arizona's reforms in place and new services providers entering those systems, we can start to answer these vital questions. Students will interview entrepreneurs, lawyers, and consumers to map the current and future provider landscape and will draft a report that offers guidance to the judges and policymakers who are shaping the future of access to justice.  Likely clients for the lab include the Utah Supreme Court's Office of Legal Services Innovation and the Arizona Supreme Court. The lab's work will also inform the work of the State Bar of California's Closing the Justice Gap Working Group, on which two of the instructors serve as public appointed members.  Students will emerge from the practicum with a richer understanding of the access to justice crisis in the United States and the range of legal, policy, and entrepreneurial interventions and opportunities that might address it. Students from a range of disciplines are welcome, including undergraduates interested in public policy. This is a one-quarter practicum. There may be a related practicum offered during spring quarter, but students do not need to commit to two quarters.  Law students wishing to take the class for R credit will perform additional research or take on additional tasks.  After the term begins, and with the consent of the instructor, students accepted into the course may transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement.  Students who take the course for R credit may have the opportunity to attend a conference at Arizona State in February that focuses on these and other access-to-justice issues.

Formerly incarcerated individuals face a range of personal and institutional challenges in their reentry into broader society. Considerable research and many programs have focused on systems reform and support and social programs to increase the likelihood of successful reentry. But technological tools also have the potential to help lower friction and increase the success of reentry. This policy lab will engage with challenging legal, social, government systems, and technological questions, with opportunities to design and/or implement new tools to aid in the reentry process. We will work with a variety of stakeholders including government organizations and programs, non-profit entities, and legal innovators to prototype and evaluate new technological solutions to facilitate the reentry process and reduce recidivism.  This practicum will build a collaborative team of diverse backgrounds and skill sets to learn from each other and enhance the overall capacity of the research and tool development. We encourage students who are interested in criminal justice, technology for social impact, access to justice, and entrepreneurship and innovation for social good to join us, including upper-division and graduate students from Law, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, MS&amp;E, Public Policy, and the social sciences.

        "description": "Illegal fishing has long plagued the world's oceans, undermining economic development, national security, food security, and human rights -- and nowhere is this more starkly evident than in the Pacific Ocean. From cans of tuna to shrimp cocktail, the legality of how this seafood is caught and processed is often uncertain. A recent World Resources Institute study estimates that half of illegal marine trading networks come from the Pacific, totaling between 3.7 and 7.2 million tons of fish stolen from fishermen and coastal nations. Of further critical concern is the role of forced labor within the industry.  This policy lab confronts the global environmental, human rights and privacy challenges associated with the existing framework of international laws and policies. The research delves into international laws that apply to the high seas, illegal fishing and forced labor and slavery to locate leverage points and explore innovative solutions, including how new technologies might be developed and deployed. The research contributes to the agendas of two organizations that are leaders in addressing Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in supply chains (FishWise), and idenfifying leverage points to reduce forced labor and slavery in fishing activities (Rights Lab, University of Nottingham). Effective solutions to these problems required broad collaborations among nations, international seafood companies, nonprofit organizations, and universities.  Students will have the opportunity to explore one of the following two topics. The Supply Chain Risk Tool (SCRT), co-led by FishWise, encompasses the development of a tool to enable companies to identify and address risk of IUU fishing activities in supply chains. The role of the students will be to design a user research plan, which could help to identify users, needs, and processes that the SCRT could support. A Port Resilience Framework to Address Forced Labor, co-led by colleagues from the Rights Lab at University of Nottingham, will be an effort to apply a resilience framework to address modern forms of slavery in port communities. Students will be able to apply resilience concepts to ports by identifying key systemic issues, legislative assets and problems, local institutions, and policies or practices.  The Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions serves as the liaison to both policy clients stated above and will also connect students with partners such as large seafood companies, and human rights and environmental NGOs. Students will produce policy briefs that will contribute to a third installment in a comprehensive public report issued by the Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions. The practicum seeks law students as well as graduate and well-qualified undergraduate students in such programs as earth systems, computer science, public policy, business, sociology, and marine biology.

        "description": "Client: Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance.  China is investing in massive foreign-infrastructure construction, notably in emerging economies. Whether that infrastructure is high-carbon or low-carbon will largely determine the future of climate change. Many universities and institutions are studying the carbon impacts of China's foreign-infrastructure investment. That research tends to compare China's aggregate fossil-fuel-versus-renewable investments, assessing whether those investments meet a clean-energy ideal. New research at Stanford's Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance is undertaking this analysis differently. It seeks to map the players and financial flows of global infrastructure investment in a way that compares the carbon intensity of Chinese-financed infrastructure projects in important emerging economies with the carbon intensity of energy infrastructure in those countries that has been financed by multilateral, bilateral, and other non-Chinese entities. This method is designed to reflect the way global infrastructure funding works, politically and economically, in actual practice -- and thus to elucidate particularly realistic ways to meaningfully decarbonize Chinese infrastructure financing.  In this policy lab, which is the second phase of the spring 2020 lab, students will advance research toward two sorts of deliverables: a data-analysis and data-visualization tool to map players, financing structures, and carbon emissions from Chinese-financed infrastructure projects in key host countries; and a written account of how Chinese-financed infrastructure is playing out in those countries. The research will involve close interaction with key officials at key infrastructure-financing institutions in China and around the world. Graduate students from across Stanford are invited to apply. Data-analysis skills, energy-finance understanding, and proficiency in Mandarin are useful skills for this work, but they are not required.  The lab seeks graduate students from the disciplines of law, business, engineering and environmental science, and East Asian Studies.

        "title": "Policy Practicum: New Regulatory and Policy Frameworks for Government Remote Work in Times of Crisis",
        "description": "Background:  With the sudden onslaught of the pandemic COVID 19 creating emergency requirements regarding professional and social distancing, government agencies in California have had to implement &quot;telework&quot; or remote work policies quickly, with limited guidance and limited awareness of best practices.  Government agencies are complex institutions, performing diverse and vital functions and employing a wide variety of types of employees, some of whom are represented by labor bargaining units.  They handle and manage information subject to privacy protections, and many of the communications engaged in between employees and with members of the public are also subject to public disclosure requirements.  Public agencies also face financial, technological, and personnel resource limitations.  California state agencies need to be able to anticipate work and access issues due to its experiences with natural and manmade disasters, frequently in the form of earthquakes and fires.  The disruptions created by this  pandemic, because of its impacts on the workforce and economy, are extreme but highlight the need for broad reconsideration of work functions, locations, and worker support.  The Project:  Working with one state agency, the California State Controller's Office (SCO), students will research and evaluate best practices for remote work by government employees and develop recommendations to ensure the critical government functions continue during a variety of disasters and emergencies.  Students will also try to learn what remote work policies could be effectively implemented over the long term.  After gaining an understanding of the key functions of the State Controller's Office, students will research and provide answers to several critical questions, which may include:  What are legally required timelines for performance of key tasks and functions and how do these requirements implicate remote work?  What are the best practices related to chain of command, communications, and redundancy protocols to ensure ongoing operations?  How can remote work policies ensure that decision-making remains efficient and effective?  What are the priority factors to analyze when determining which staff positions should be designated &quot;essential&quot; or &quot;non-essential&quot;?  In the current coronavirus environment, how does this analysis implicate who can or should be physically onsite?  What are the processes that are required to be in place should an employee whose work is designated essential have a person who is at risk at home?  What are the implications for public employees related to FLSA, OSHA, and Workers' Compensation Insurance compliance?  How have business, other government agencies, and nonprofits resolved these issues and what are their best practices?  How can those practices be implemented within the SCO?  What are the technology requirements that can effectuate remote work?  What types of encryption are necessary to protect private and sensitive data?  If workers are using their privately-owned technology (e.g., cellular phones, computers), what are the possible exposures due to public records act reporting requirements and in a litigation setting?  What are the equity implications of operationalizing remote work policies?  What are the demographics of the positions with functions that can and cannot most likely take advantage of remote work?  What are implications for the worker experience of remote work in different demographic groups?  What are the impacts of differential levels of access to adequate technology at home?  What is a cost-benefit analysis of shifting to more remote work?  Are there cost-savings through potential reduction of work force or physical space?  If so, what are the equity implications?  What are the environmental benefits of shifting to remote work?  Student Skills and Interests:  All students are welcome regardless of experience as long as you are interested in this topic.  However, if you have any experience working with government agencies, in disaster or emergency prepared or response, or in applying an equity analysis to policies and programs, please note that in your consent form.

And yet, the international community is increasingly divided when it comes to advancing the project of international justice.  Whereas earlier armed conflicts have inspired the establishment of international or hybrid tribunals (such as the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and the Special Court for Sierra Leone) or were referred to the International Criminal Court (such as the situations in Sudan and Libya), today&iquest;s conflicts have been met with a pervasive tribunal fatigue and geopolitical impasses. The U.N. Security Council in particular has been hamstrung by the propensity of Russia, sometimes with China in tow, to veto (or threaten to veto) robust accountability proposals that have been put forward. As a result, advocates have looked to other organs and institutions within and without the United Nations to respond to the commission of international crimes. The General Assembly, the Human Rights Council, and even the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have thus all become engines of accountability, in part because they are not subject to the veto. In addition, civil society actors (such as the Commission on International Justice &amp; Accountability and the Afghanistan Human Rights and Democracy Organization) have stepped up to undertake investigative functions that would ordinarily be performed by sovereign states or international prosecutors.  This lab will support several of these institutions and organizations in their efforts to move justice processes forward. A number of civil society and non-governmental organizations are conducting thorough criminal investigations and forming detailed dossiers on potential perpetrators in an effort to jumpstart national proceedings, including those proceeding under extraordinary bases of jurisdiction, and to lay the groundwork for international prosecutions when&iquest;and if&iquest;an opening appears. Such organizations are also working to support multilateral and unilateral sanctions regimes, such as the United States&iquest; Global Magnitsky Act. New digital technologies and techniques&iquest;such as  big data analytics, artificial intelligence, digital forensics, and blockchain&iquest;are enabling and supporting more searching open source investigations into these atrocities situations. With this lab, students will conduct both factual and legal research on behalf of partner organizations and participate in advocacy efforts to build a more robust international justice architecture. They will also contribute to efforts at other academic institutions to connect students to this work.

The Stanford Criminal Justice Center at Stanford Law School is partnering with the award-winning journalist Rachel Louise Snyder on &quot;The Regilla Project: Creating a National Census on Women Imprisoned for Killing their Abusers.&quot; The research studies the frequency with which women are imprisoned for killing their abusers. Spring 2022 research entails the following protocols:  1. Surveying women who are currently serving sentences at CCWF prison (in Chowchilla, CA) where relevant intimate partner violence was involved.  2. Analyzing and aggregating responses from returned surveys.  3. Researching how the cases of women currently incarcerated for murder and manslaughter were written about in the press, and whether intimate partner violence was included as a circumstance.  4. Undertaking qualitative research of formerly incarcerated survivors to document their reentry pathways, including challenges and successes. Collecting and making this data available will shed important light on the nature of the female correctional population, the largest growing segment of the U.S. prison population, and might guide policy discussions on charging, sentencing, prison programming, parole and reentry policies and decisions.

The administrative challenges local officials are confronting in the 2020 election are unprecedented in U.S. history. As the primary elections reveal, the COVID-19 pandemic threatens our democracy as much as it threatens public health. Jurisdictions around the country are scrambling to deal with massive shifts to mail balloting, polling place closures, and loss of poll workers.  Students in this policy lab will investigate the measures state and local officials are taking to protect their elections from the effect of the pandemic.  Students will research, write and/or update policy memos on election preparedness in battleground states, work with our partners to recruit poll workers to reduce the risk of polling place closures due to poll worker shortages, prepare materials for voter outreach and education, and help ensure polling place safety. After the election, students will assess the success of various aspects of the administration of the election, and, in the winter term, produce a detailed post-mortem group report. All students will produce team-based policy memos and internal presentations to be integrated into the final report.  This policy lab will continue over two quarters with a small subset of students from the fall term selected to join the winter research team. The winter quarter will focus on finalizing the research and work product initiated in the fall term.  Students from all disciplines are welcome to apply (including undergraduates). However, preference will be given to current team members of the Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project and those with experience in election law and policy. We especially welcome applications from students in the law, public policy, political science, and design disciplines, and from those with strong writing and editing skills.  Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2 or 3 units (Section 02), depending on paper length.  The Fall term class meets remotely each week on Wednesdays, 4:15-6:15 p.m. Winter term TBD.

        "description": "The Stanford Criminal Justice Center and Stanford Center for Racial Justice at Stanford Law School are co-sponsoring this project to assess concrete ways to shift particular responsibilities from police departments to other agencies and organizations. We will explore whether there are policy possibilities lying at the intersection of the community policing movement - which advocated shifting police departments away from &quot;chasing 911 calls&quot; - and current calls to &quot;defund&quot; the police by shifting to other other agencies functions now performed by armed, uniformed officers. In particular, we will consider proposals to shift mental health response, school discipline, traffic enforcement, and homeless services away from armed, uniformed officers. What kinds of agencies should shoulder these responsibilities?  How should the transfer be accomplished?  We will also ask how these policy changes relate to, complement, or compete with other possible approaches to police reform and the transformation of public safety. Should such changes be part of an overall effort to shrink the footprint of police departments, to change the nature of what police departments do, or both? How, if at all, should changes in police budgets be used to drive reform?  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Performance, Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Paper.

        "description": "Client: Stanford Law School.  Deliverables: Resources for national DEI database for law schools, final summary report.  Law schools, other professional schools, and institutions of higher education all around the country have been reevaluating their structure, mission, curricula, pedagogy, hiring and admissions practices, climate, and other elements of academic life with the goal of ascertaining how best to promote a more just, fair, inclusive, and diverse environment for learning.  Students, staff, administrators, and faculty have created listservs and other informal platforms to share ideas and resources, but to date there has been no single research-based platform that gathers cutting edge and canonical work on the wide range of potentially relevant topics to guide and provide structure to the design of reforms or support advocacy on DE&amp;I issues.  Stanford Law School and the Robert Crown Library have launched a beta version of the first national clearinghouse to index research of this kind.  This policy lab provides interested students an opportunity to expand the index, help develop and implement standards for curation, incorporate feedback from users, engage in policy discussions about iterative design, and develop frameworks for assessment of the project.  The primary work plan involves deepening the available research on a number of topics including: 1L and advanced doctrinal pedagogy, critical race theory, other critical approaches to law, cultural competence and cultural humility in training for law and other service professions, professional judgment, assessments of DE&amp;I training in the private and public sector, published templates for university DE&amp;I reforms, principles of academic freedom, global innovations in DE&amp;I theory, as well as interdisciplinary research on anti-racism, implicit bias and other forms of cognitive bias, viewpoint discrimination, micro-aggression, trauma, and stereotype threat.  Students will work with Prof. Norman W. Spaulding and reference librarians at the law school. There may also be opportunity to work with students, staff, administrators, and faculty at other law schools and other university departments.

        "title": "Policy Practicum:  Systems Thinking for Law and Public Policy",
        "description": "Virtually every public policy has causes and consequences beyond those that are intended or immediately visible. This is true of criminal law policies that use algorithmic predictions of flight before trial; environmental policies involving greenhouse gas emissions and conventional pollutants; and social and health policies that address homelessness, institutional racism, and the distribution of Covid vaccines, to name just a few examples. The causes of the problems that these policies seek to address are complex. As a result, these policies often fail and sometimes have unintended adverse consequences.  &quot;Systems thinking&quot; is a framework that describes the web of associations in which such policies reside, with the goals of understanding the multiple causes of problems and designing policies that lead to stable, positive changes. Understanding systems thinking and systems change is a core skill for policy makers.  This course continues the work of a similar Policy Lab in spring 2021 in helping create an online course for use by future students that illustrates the main concepts of systems thinking (including stocks and flows, balancing and reinforcing loops, and systems archetypes) and systems change using real-world case studies.  After several introductory classes devoted to learning these concepts and learning how to use the web-based systems mapping tool, Kumu, students will work on systems design projects for eventual inclusion in the online course.  Grading is on the Mandatory P/R/F scale and takes into consideration attendance, participation, and collaboration; quality of the case studies and presentations.  Although there is no bright line between two and three units, the number of units should reflect the amount of time you devote to the course. Relevant variables are:  1.  The complexity of a case study and its attendant system diagrams, including how much research needs to go into developing it; 2.  Whether, in addition to a case study, you develop a module dealing with a systems archetype.  If you work with a partner, it's probably best if the two of you are taking the course for the same number of credits you are so that work is divided equitably.  There are no prerequisites for enrollment in the Policy Lab, and students in any academic program with knowledge or strong interests in legal, environmental, social, and health policies are welcome.

        "title": "Policy Practicum:  Examining Mandatory Arbitration and NDAs for Gender Discrimination Claims",
        "description": "Client: Lift Our Voices, https://www.liftourvoices.org/.  In recent years, a large fraction of U.S. employers--including many leading law firms -- have required their employees to sign contracts containing mandatory arbitration clauses and &quot;non-disclosure agreements&quot; (NDAs). Available research suggests that more than 60 million American workers are bound by these arbitration clauses, which require employees who have any type of legal claim arising out of their work or workplace to waive their right to trial and resolve their claims, on an individual basis, in private arbitration. Traditionally, arbitration takes place behind closed doors, and the details of the employee's claim (and employer's response), any evidence presented to the arbitrators, the proceedings themselves and the ultimate outcome are confidential. Moreover, employees who are offered monetary settlements to resolve their arbitration claims -- or lawsuits, for those who were not compelled to arbitrate under a contractual provision -- are typically required to sign NDAs as a condition of receiving compensation. As a result of arbitration and NDAs, information about wrong-doing in the workplace -- even egregious wrong-doing -- never becomes public, arguably diminishing the ability of the legal system to deter harmful behavior. Moreover, with claims resolved individually, in private, and settlements protected by NDAs, it is impossible to detect a pattern of wrongful behavior and to hold wrongdoers to account in the public square. These consequences seem particularly problematic in claims arising from gender discrimination, particularly sexual harassment. Secrecy also prevents us from discovering whether women of color or low-income women of all colors are particularly disadvantaged by mandatory arbitration and NDAs.  The expanding use of mandatory arbitration and NDAs in employment claims has evoked considerable controversy and legislation has been introduced at both the national and state level to prohibit the inclusion of these clauses in employment contracts. However, the legislation has yet to move forward on the national level and whether state statutes will withstand challenge is currently unclear. Moreover, there is little systematic evidence of the consequences of mandatory arbitration and NDAs, leaving both supporters and opponents to rely on anecdotes. There is little hard information on the numbers of employees covered by arbitration contracts or how this varies by industry sector and employee gender, race, ethnicity or socio-economic characteristics.  Importantly we do not know how the existence of these contracts affects men and women's willingness to bring their claims to their employers' attention or how claiming varies by race, ethnicity or employee status. Nor do we know how pursuing claims for gender discrimination, including sexual harassment, affects claimants' future career trajectories.  The Client for this policy lab, Lift Our Voices, was co-founded by women's rights advocates and broadcast journalists Gretchen Carlson and Julie Roginsky. Ms. Carlson's sexual harassment suit against powerful former Fox News chairman and CEO Roger Ailes helped pave the way for the #metoo movement. Roginsky left Fox after settling a lawsuit for sexual harassment and discrimination against Fox News, its former co-president Bill Shine and Ailes. To learn more about Lift Our Voices, go to https://www.liftourvoices.org/  The goal of this practicum is to produce objective empirical evidence -- both quantitative and qualitative -- that can be used in Life Our Voices and others' advocacy activities regarding mandatory arbitration and NDAs, including advocacy -- if the data support this -- that argues in favor of restricting or precluding mandatory arbitration and NDAs in some or all circumstances.  In Spring 2021 students in this practicum met with Gretchen Carlson and Julie Roginsky to identify the questions for which empirical evidence would be most useful for policy reform advocacy. Based on these discussions and their review of relevant commentary, the students decided to break up into two teams, each of which would design a research project. Project 1 will interview plaintiff and defense lawyers to develop a better understanding of the incentives for victims of sexual harassment and sexual assault to sign non-disclosure agreements. Project 2 will interview corporate legal counsel in corporations (and potentially law firms) that have abandoned mandatory pre-dispute arbitration contract clauses to develop a better understanding of why these companies and firms abandoned arbitration and what have been the outcomes for the organizations to date. At the end of the spring quarter, each team prepared a memorandum outlining the issues that their team focused on and reviewing the relevant case law and recent statutory reforms. In addition, each team prepared a data collection protocol including draft questionnaires and lists of potential interviewees. The data collection protocols were informed by informal discussions with SLS faculty who are knowledgeable about these issues as well as a few outside advisers.  The goals of the fall quarter are to implement these research designs, collect and analyze data and prepare white papers to share with the clients. Early in the quarter, students will meet with Mss. Carlson and Roginski to discuss policy developments since the spring and may revise the spring quarter students' research designs in response.  The Canvas page for the fall practicum includes the memoranda and other materials the students produced in the spring quarter. Students interested in registering for the fall practicum should review these materials, keeping in mind that they are free to elaborate on them if they wish and if new policy developments suggest this would is appropriate. If a sufficient number of students register for the practicum one or more related projects may be added to our agenda.

        "description": "Clients: California Native American Tribes, prescribed burn associations, federal legislative and executive branch decision makers.  Wildfire has emerged as one of the most pressing biodiversity, air pollution and public health threats in the Western United States. Advancing land stewardship at sufficient scale to substantially improve the resilience of western forests to fire is critical to reducing wildfire risks and air pollution exposure for the tens of millions that live downwind. Communities are under threat as never before from catastrophic wildfire. Electric utilities face enormous challenges even as they strive to decarbonize their systems. In short, solving for wildfire resilience is an enormous technical and regulatory challenge. In this course, students will learn the basics of the wildfire policy debate in the west with a focus on California. Lectures will focus on both scientific and legal aspects of the challenge. In addition, students will work in groups on legal and regulatory analysis aimed at supporting better decision making on wildfire at the state and federal level. Students will work in partnership with postdocs and legal fellows on their group projects and may have the opportunity to present the results of their work to both clients and policymakers. The course is intended for students interested in multi-disciplinary approaches to public policy problems. No background in either the Clean Air Act, federal land management or wildfire policy is required. Students will engage in weekly lectures and discussions of wildfire science and policy, including student presentations and guest lectures by scientists, practitioners and policymakers. Students will also meet each week with Professors Sivas and Wara, and other members of the teaching team, in working sessions to discuss progress on team projects. Students may present the results of their research to California legislative and executive branch staff engaged in developing new approaches to wildfire policy. Elements used in grading: Attendance, Performance, Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Paper.

        "title": "Policy Practicum:  Stanford Conflict Resolution Lab",
        "description": "Client: Stanford University Office of the Provost, https://provost.stanford.edu.  From the increasingly tense dynamics of the classroom and workplace to those of social media, our values and relationships are constantly being challenged. The array of conflict resolution policies, practices, and systems on Stanford's campus support our community in reestablishing guiding principles and addressing instances of harm and intolerance. Such processes are an act of community caretaking as we build healthier environments for our students, staff, and faculty.  While these processes are critical to the wellbeing of Stanford, the structure and decentralization of the University often makes it difficult for conflict resolution practitioners to effectively communicate across campus, guide community members to the appropriate process, identify where services are being replicated or missing, compare data, and share best practices. On the other hand, this type of decentralization and subsequent independence provides practitioners an opportunity to creatively design meaningful processes for those they serve.  This policy lab seeks to evaluate the benefits and possibilities of increased partnership between Stanford's conflict resolution practitioners/processes. It takes into consideration the multiple policies, practices, and systems across Stanford's campus and explores the study and application of dispute system design, mediation, and community-based restorative justice and peacemaking. Over the course of the quarter, students will analyze related policy and theory as well as conduct interviews, focus groups, and surveys of relevant parties at Stanford and peer institutions. Students will be challenged to think critically about innovative pathways for conflict resolution in a complex environment with multiple groups of stakeholders whose day-to-day lives, education, and careers are influenced by these conflict resolution processes.  Specifically, students will be separated into teams and asked to generate reports which answer the following questions:  1. Would greater unification across Stanford's conflict resolution policies, practices, and systems be useful in building more consistent and effective processes? How do these benefits weigh against those derived from our current, independent conflict resolution processes?  2. Should data on conflict resolution at Stanford be collected in a more uniform way across the university? If so, what information must be collected and how should relevant parties then share this data across campus?  3. How do the structure and data collection mechanisms of Stanford's conflict resolution processes compare to peer institutions? What lessons can we learn from these peer institutions and what would be useful to implement at Stanford?  Stanford's Office of the Provost serves as the client for this policy lab. Students will frequently engage with conflict resolution practitioners across the University and at peer institutions to develop their final reports. These recommendations will be presented by students to the client at the end of the quarter and then considered by the Office of the Provost for future implementation at the University. This policy lab seeks law students and graduate and well-qualified undergraduate students in programs such as sociology, CSRE, political science, psychology, philosophy, and others.  The lab seeks graduate students from the law, education, and business schools, and from Sociology and other fields that emphasize peace studies and/or conflict resolution.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer, with consent of the instructor, from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement  Students enrolled in Section 01 will be graded H/P/R/F in Autumn Quater and MP/R/F in Spring Quarter.  Students approved to take the course for R-credit will be graded H/P/R/F.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Performance, Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Paper.

        "title": "Policy Practicum:  Draw Congress: Stanford Redistricting Project",
        "description": "Client: DrawCongress.org.  The 2021-22 redistricting cycle will determine for the subsequent decade whether congressional and legislative elections will be free and fair or whether they will be inherently biased in favor of one party.  With remaining ambiguity over federal partisan gerrymandering claims removed with the Supreme Court's decision in Rucho v. Common Cause (2019), parties in control of the redistricting process will seek now, as previously, to use their power to craft district lines to their advantage.  Lawyers will continue to litigate claims based on race discrimination, malapportionment, and state constitutional grounds, and courts may be placed in the position of drawing districts themselves when parties cannot agree on a plan.  However, we know from previous cycles that the most important time to affect the redistricting process is in the frenzied year when lines are being drawn.  Groups dedicated to redistricting in the public interest must be mobilized now to ensure that congressional and legislative boundaries reflect concerns other than those held by the incumbents drawing the lines.  The Stanford Public Interest Redistricting Project (or DrawCongress.Org) will perform a unique role in the 2021-2022 redistricting process.  It will both influence the redistricting process in various states and serve as a benchmark against which incumbent-drawn plans can be judged by courts, the media, and the public at large.  By creating and displaying a series of nonpartisan, legally defensible plans for all 435 U.S. House districts, the project will illustrate how communities can be represented and, unlike with incumbent-drawn plans, will justify decisions made among the various tradeoffs that inevitably confront line drawers.  As with the 2011-2012 redistricting cycle when this project was housed at Columbia Law School, DrawCongress.Org will serve an educational and advocacy mission.  This policy lab trains law students as the next generation of redistricting experts who will then draw a series of plans to be placed on a website.  Each plan will be accompanied by a report, modeled on Professor Persily's reports when he serves as a Special Master for redistricting disputes, which will explain the considerations in drawing the particular plan, justify the decisions that are made, and explain why the plan complies with applicable law.  Accompanying each plan will be a block equivalency file, which will allow courts, legislators, journalists, or any other interested party to recreate the plan should they wish to deploy it in &quot;the real world.&quot;  In addition, for the first time, the website will also welcome submissions from outside of Stanford if they comply with the requirements for each plan that is included.  The experience with this project ten years ago demonstrated how much attention a well-planned, nonpartisan outside redistricting effort can attract. Plans drawn as part of this project were submitted to legislatures, mentioned by courts, and depicted in numerous publications.  (See Adam Liptak's 2011 profile on the project at https://tinyurl.com/y8yon5u5) In drawing a nonpartisan map for all of Congress, this new effort will command attention from decision makers engaged in the 2021 redistricting process.

        "title": "Policy Practicum: Unlocking Technology to Promote Access to Justice",
        "description": "The U.S. legal system is in the grips of an access to justice (A2J) crisis. In roughly three-quarters of filed civil cases, one side lacks a lawyer and so must navigate the legal system alone, as a self-represented litigant. Unnecessary complexity and lack of access to tools that aid efficiency also reduce the effectiveness and availability of legal aid lawyers. The resulting access crisis is most pronounced in eviction cases, consumer debt cases, and family law and domestic violence cases, where self-represented litigants often square off against opponents with lawyers, from landlords to credit card and debt collection companies to better-resourced spouses and partners. The COVID-19 pandemic has both drawn attention to this calamity in our legal system and generated real momentum among major institutions and stakeholders in thinking about how to solve it.  This policy lab will continue the work performed during the fall version of the practicum in designing and launching an ambitious, multi-jurisdictional effort to help self-represented litigants through technology. The project seeks to simplify and standardize electronic filing systems by creating scalable technology tools in areas such as evictions, collections, and domestic violence.  Students in the fall practicum interviewed state supreme court justices, court technology specialists, and key A2J voices in numerous jurisdictions to understand the A2J landscape in each. The winter quarter lab will deepen these relationships and move forward with the design and launch of the pilot, culminating in a kick-off convening at Stanford that brings together stakeholders from each of the participating jurisdictions.  As with the fall version, the practicum will be led by former Cisco General Counsel Mark Chandler, Professor David Freeman Engstrom, Co-Director of the Center on the Legal Profession, and Margaret Hagan, Director of the Stanford Legal Design Lab.  Prior participation in the fall practicum is not a prerequisite. Technical expertise is welcome but not needed, and we hope to draw students from a variety of disciplines, including undergraduates.

Technology is bringing new opportunities to how consumers will interact with contracts, and this class will explore what is possible, what consumers might need and want, and what actually works in practice.  In this jointly hosted project between CodeX and the Legal Design Lab, students will work on teams to interview consumers about their experiences with contracts, to test new interactive and computable contract models with them, and to propose best practices about how technology might improve consumer's ability to understand, use, and benefit from insurance contracts.  The policy lab will contribute to regulators' understanding of what the near-future of consumer contracts might be, and how to take a human-centered, data-driven approach to consumer empowerment. Students will contribute new insights to good practices and products that better protect consumers by assessing, developing, and testing the advantages and limitations of legal technology.

        "description": "Client: American University of Afghanistan (AUAF).  The fall of the Afghan government to the Taliban in August 2021 has created an urgent crisis for millions of Afghans. Those at particularly high risk of Taliban attacks and reprisals include women and girls, ethnic and religious minority groups, human rights advocates, journalists, and individuals who worked with or on behalf of the United States during the 20-year war in Afghanistan. The U.S. government was able to evacuate some of these individuals and their families, but hundreds of thousands more remain in Afghanistan, and many are seeking any opportunity for safe passage out of the country. They include thousands of staff members, former students, and other affiliates of the American University of Afghanistan (AUAF), a U.S.-funded institution in Kabul that has provided educational opportunities to thousands of graduates.  The U.S. government has pledged to continue to support vulnerable Afghans who want to leave the country, but the situation remains highly uncertain. Afghans are eligible for humanitarian parole, a temporary status that could allow them to come to the United States. However, few Afghans have been granted this status. Other avenues for legal immigration, such as the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) process, have also faced substantial delays. The U.S. government will need to look for new and creative policy solutions to address the ongoing refugee crisis in Afghanistan.  Students in this policy lab will advise AUAF in its efforts to pursue legal and policy options to support its students, alumni, staff, and affiliated families who are seeking to evacuate the country. Student researchers will track bottlenecks and other challenges in processing humanitarian parole, visas, asylum, and refugee applications. Research includes understanding the roles of U.S. government agencies, tracking updates to U.S. government policy regarding Afghan refugees, and proposing avenues for additional legal and policy advocacy that could help Afghans seeking to come to the United States. Students will gain experience with laws and policies related to immigration and refugees and leverage their research to improve the U.S. government's overall policy approach to the refugee crisis in Afghanistan. This experience will culminate in a policy brief and presentation for AUAF (Winter) and in a full report for U.S. policymakers (Spring) about potential policy and legal pathways to resettle Afghan refugees in the United States.  This policy lab welcomes all students with a strong interest in immigrant and refugee rights. A background in law, public policy, political science, Central Asian studies, or human rights would be useful, but is not necessary. Dari, Pashto, or Farsi language capabilities are a bonus, but are also not necessary. We are also looking for students with experience in design thinking for social innovations.

        "title": "Policy Practicum: Creating an Impact Framework for Stanford's School of Climate and Sustainability",
        "description": "Clients: Stanford Dean Kathryn &quot;Kam&quot; Moler and Vice Dean Stephan Graham, respectively transition dean and vice dean of the new School.  The mission of Stanford University's new School of Climate and Sustainability is to &quot;create a future where humans and nature thrive in concert and in perpetuity.&quot; The School intends to pursue this mission through three pathways:  1.  Advancing knowledge critical to sustaining life on Earth and to ensuring the benefits of a healthy planet extend to all people.  2.  Preparing students as future sustainability leaders through rigorous, engaged education and research.  3.  Engaging with partners to generate and scale local, national, and global solutions to the defining challenge for humanity.  This Policy Lab practicum will examine how the School can marshal its resources most effectively to advance knowledge through research, prepare students for leadership roles, and engage with partners to scale these core functions.  With respect to the advancement of knowledge, we will seek to understand how research aimed at improving sustainability in several areas (e.g., climate change, agriculture) can be supported and disseminated to educate and influence decisions and behaviors of policy makers, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and citizens, while remaining impartial and balanced throughout the process.  Without limiting ourselves to these areas, we will look at examples where research has and has not influenced decision making, with an eye to understanding conducive pathways and barriers. To use a recent example, suppose that a researcher wishes to influence policy makers', builders', or homeowners' decisions to install residential gas stoves because of the climate and health problems caused by their methane emissions: What are the roles of publication in peer-reviewed journals, publication in popular media, public lectures, and legislative testimony on the pathway from research to decision making? In addition to online research, we will interview faculty at Stanford and elsewhere.  With respect to education, we will ask what mixture of theoretical knowledge and practical skills will best prepare graduates for positions where they will lead sustainability efforts in government, business, and the nonprofit sector. We have much to learn from Stanford's Sustainability Science and Practice (SUST) program and similar programs at other universities.  At the same time as we identify pathways, or &quot;theories of change,&quot; for achieving the new School's objectives, we will identify indicators of progress along the way. Referring to the example of methane emissions from residential stoves, if reaching an intended audience requires publicizing the findings in popular media, relevant indicators would be the size and influence of the audience being reached. Given the multitude and fluidity of variables that contribute to outcomes, we will use what's been termed &quot;contribution analysis&quot; rather than statistical evaluation techniques to assess the impact of particular efforts.  Based on our proposed frameworks for the School's research and teaching, we will ask how engagement with external partners can contribute to its mission.  The Policy Lab's deliverable with respect to research will be a generalized framework that will enable researchers to chart a path from developing and testing hypotheses to disseminating their findings and influencing decision makers to act on them. The framework will also enable researchers to assess their progress along the path.  The deliverable with respect to teaching will be the identification of analogies in the preparation and certification of professionals in medicine, law, and other fields, with the aim of assisting the new School in improving its preparation of students as sustainability leaders.  The course is limited to 12 students from across the University. While there are no prerequisites, we hope to include students with backgrounds in sustainability and social metrics.

The HRCRC has been tasked by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to propose policies to repair enduring historical harms to San Francisco's Black community. HRCRC invited the Stanford Law Gould Center for Conflict Resolution to develop a Policy Lab practicum to assist with a Report on the History of Black Disenfranchisement in San Francisco (Report). The Report drafted by the Spring 2022 Policy Lab studied the key housing policies and laws that resulted in relevant racial disparities in housing, education, health, and intergenerational wealth. The Lab will continue in the Autumn 2022 term to complete the Report and expand the scope of research through design of a Community-Led Oral History to Capture Perspectives from Past to Present. The oral history will capture the lived experiences of San Francisco's Black community. This goes beyond what may already be in the historical literature and extends to oral narratives from those who lived through important chapters in San Francisco's history. Their perspective is especially important in connecting the past with the recent present harms and providing a roadmap to achieving the HRCRC's goal of systemic change (not just policy change).

        "title": "Policy Practicum: Suing to Stop Climate Change: Case Studies in International Climate Litigation",
        "description": "Client or Policy Partner: Rand Corporation.  Over the past 10 years, climate change litigation has exploded globally. While there is some disagreement about what litigation should be understood as arising from or directed at &quot;climate change,&quot; the category encompasses large numbers of lawsuits challenging permitting of new fossil fuel projects, claims by indigenous communities and others about contemporary effects of climate change on their health and livelihoods, and claims on behalf of children about the future effects of climate change on their lives. Increasingly, plaintiffs claim government failures to address climate change constitute violations of international human rights.  About three-quarters of identified cases have been brought in the United States, but a growing fraction have been litigated in other jurisdictions, including the global south. Claims have been brought against both governments and private corporations, seeking injunctive relief and damages. Although much of this litigation is ongoing and plaintiffs have failed to prevail in many, there have also been high profile successes in which courts held governments or corporations liable and ordered them to adopt policies to achieve greater reductions in global warming.  The RAND Institute for Civil Justice and the Feinberg Center for Catastrophic Risk at RAND are considering developing a new research agenda focusing on climate change litigation. To assist in their planning, this Practicum proposes to conduct a series of case studies of recent climate change lawsuits focusing on the procedural strategies that parties are using to achieve their goals, and with what success. Who are the plaintiffs that are bringing these suits? Are their efforts coordinated internationally? Who are the lawyers representing the claimants? Who is funding the litigation? What jurisdictions and tribunals, domestic and international, have proved most attractive from the plaintiffs' perspective? What is the nature and extent of corporate, insurers' and reinsurers' liability? What real world impact are these lawsuits having on the environment?  At the beginning of the quarter, the students will meet via zoom with principals from the two RAND centers that are the clients for this project to discuss their goals for the project. After refining the overall plan for the case study research, each student will select a case to research. Students will meet from time to time with Prof. Hensler and the Teaching Assistant for the practicum to discuss progress and share findings. As part of their research, students may also have the ability to speak with local scholars or attorneys involved in climate litigation in relevant international jurisdictions. At the end of the quarter, students will collaborate on a white paper summarizing the findings of the case studies, to be shared with RAND.  Some or all students will then travel to RAND in Santa Monica, CA to share and discuss their findings with RAND researchers. There is potential for these case studies to eventually be shared publicly.  Law and graduate students with coursework, research, or practical experience related to environmental law and policy, global litigation, advanced civil procedure, or comparative law preferred.

        "title": "Policy Practicum:  Restoring Net Neutrality",
        "description": "In 2017, the FCC eliminated all net neutrality protections and renounced its authority over broadband. That stunning reversal of two decades of FCC policy set off a public firestorm, prompted states like California to step in with their own protections, and led to protracted legal battles.  Though the timing is unclear, a new FCC will likely revisit net neutrality with the goal of restoring open internet protections at the federal level. Two of the current four commissioners have said restoring net neutrality is a high priority. Gigi Sohn, a long-time supporter of net neutrality, is the nominee for the fifth seat.  Additionally, the European Union's political leadership is promoting a plan to require some online apps to pay broadband providers directly so that their services can be used by those broadband providers' customers. This would reverse decades of precedent and is a direct assault on the EU's net neutrality protections.  That means this fall will present a unique window for research and policy papers on net neutrality. Historically, the FCC has given deep consideration to input from citizens, companies, interest groups, and public policy experts. The EU's proposal will also likely have an open public consultation window, where filings from experts will be given great weight.  This policy lab gives students the opportunity to participate in these processes, and be trained to become the next generation of net neutrality and telecommunications law experts. Students will have an opportunity to make a lasting mark on real public policy both domestically and internationally.  The FCC's and EU's choices are crucial to issues like platform dominance, digital equity, and the digital divide. Students in this policy lab will work alongside Stanford Law Professor Barbara van Schewick, widely considered to be the world's foremost expert on net neutrality. Her work has shaped net neutrality policies around the world, including the FCC's 2015 net neutrality protections and California's 2018 net neutrality law, as well as the European Union's 2016, 2020, and 2022 guidelines implementing Europe's net neutrality law. Students will do research and produce materials related to the upcoming proceedings. Documents include white papers, explainer documents, official submissions, and more.  A background in net neutrality or telecom law is helpful, but not required. We hope to draw students from a variety of disciplines, including computer science, economics, statistics, public policy, and journalism.

        "description": "Political, social, cultural, and racial polarization compromise the mission of higher education to promote intellectually rigorous, open, inclusive inquiry; to train a diverse student population to work productively across difference in a pluralistic society; to produce cutting edge research; and to train leaders capable of creating innovative solutions to major social problems.  The policy lab will explore curricular and co-curricular interventions that have the potential to reduce the adverse effects of polarization.  Lab members will gather research in social and cognitive psychology, history, conflict mediation, racial, gender and political subordination, deliberative democratic theory, and other fields to identify methods that can be adapted to higher education.  Students will also gather and assess evidence of recent interventions and reforms at Stanford and other universities.  Our goal is to develop and publish guidance for universities considering reforms that treat free speech and inclusion as mutually constitutive, rather than contrary, principles.  Emphasis will be given to guidance showing how skills acquisition by all stakeholders can promote open discourse, meaningful inclusion, and support understanding alternative perspectives. Students will conduct research, meet with experts, design policy reforms, and develop content for a website that publishes the research, guidance, and reform models.

        "title": "Policy Practicum: Reducing Copyright Barriers to Creativity: The Problem of Orphan Works",
        "description": "Orphan works--copyrighted works that have no readily identifiable owner--represent the single greatest legal hurdle to creativity today. A film maker wants to make a documentary about the portrayal of minority groups in 1950s motion pictures, but cannot track down the present copyright owners of the dozens of film clips that must be licensed to complete the project. A video game producer has found just the right sound recordings to sample in its latest release, but cannot locate their copyright owners to negotiate a license. The examples can be multiplied across all forms of creative commerce.  The copyright doctrine of fair use will excuse some, but far from all, of these uses, and the doctrine's application is at best unpredictable. Legislative fixes for the orphan works problem have been attempted both in the US and abroad, but with little success. Following two years of hearings, Congress in 2008 came close to passing an orphan works bill proposed by the US Copyright Office, but ultimately stepped away from the effort.  This policy lab will evaluate the prospects for an alternative--but so far untested--solution to the problem of orphan works:  private insurance products that will underwrite the legal and economic risk of using copyrighted works in situations where transaction costs make the negotiation of a license impracticable.  Participants in the lab will interview stakeholders to investigate the feasibility of private insurance covering the use of orphan works. Among the stakeholders interviewed will be insurers and other insurance industry institutions; content owners across a range of industries and content users across a range of institutions. Experts from the US Copyright Office will also participate in a teaching capacity, on a periodic basis, to provide context for the challenge of orphan works and the work the Office has done on this issue.

        "title": "Policy Practicum: Integrating Water and Land Use Policy in the West:  The Missing Link",
        "description": "The western United States is currently experiencing what may be the longest and most severe &quot;megadrought&quot; in modern U.S. history.  Current U.S. drought data shows virtually all of the Southwest in severe, extreme, or extraordinary drought.  Reservoirs on the Colorado River are reaching record lows, and many farmers throughout the West have had their deliveries cut dramatically or face potentially massive cutbacks.  Media discussion of episodic, emergency &quot;droughts&quot; has been replaced by a recognition of the permanent &quot;aridification&quot; of the West under climate change.  Resolving the West's growing water crisis will require far greater linkage of water management and land use.  Land use drives water demand, while water availability constrains land use.  While water and land use are integrally related in fact, water and land-use policies in practice are far from integrated.  Developments are approved without reference to water availability, and water agencies often have to scramble to find and fund new projects to augment or conserve water.  New land developments or more intensive farming can lead to increased groundwater pumping that can cause neighboring residents' wells to run dry. In other cases, a failure to link water and land use can lead to abrupt building bans and/or emergency rationing. To meet the needs of a more water constrained future under climate change, a more integrated approach to water management and land use is warranted.  While John Wesley Powell once recommended close integration of water and land use, western states have historically ignored the imperative.  In the past decade or so, some states have ventured more fully into the connection between land use and water.  Some states, for example, have enacted &quot;Show Me the Water&quot; statutes that require land developments above a certain size to demonstrate that they have 50 to 100 years' worth of water available before permits can be issued.  In other places, states require land use authorities to consider water issues in developing their plans (or issuing well permits), either though consulting with their overlapping water agencies, or through developing a water &quot;element&quot; to their plans.  This sensible approach is far from universal.  We know very little, however, about how well these various approaches have worked.  Working with the Babbitt Center for Land and Water at the Lincoln Land Institute (the leader in this field) and other experts in the West, students will review and assess whether the policies that have been enacted have made a difference in practice and will develop recommendations for how water and land use can be better integrated going forward. The class will provide students with the opportunity to survey the western landscape of integrated water and land use policies, identify best practices and glaring gaps, and develop suggestions for the future.  The Lab will be led by Professor Buzz Thompson and Landreth Visiting Fellow Felicia Marcus of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, who will meet with students weekly.  Experts from across the West will also join the group throughout the fall quarter to discuss their experience and insights.  Students will prepare a report for the Babbitt Center and also have an opportunity to present their results to key state and local decision makers and informers.

        "description": "Clients: Asian Pacific Environmental Network (APEN), Communities for a Better Environment (CBE) as well as legislative and California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) decision makers.  California is a leader in establishing aggressive targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase zero-carbon energy generation. To meet its ambitious goals, California must implement a just energy transition that is founded in equity and that actively promotes environmental justice. This policy lab will work to address two pressing issues at the forefront of a zero-carbon energy transition: the ability of utilities to equitably, efficiently, and safely transition natural gas infrastructure and scale up electrification, and the ongoing reform of California&iquest;s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS).  Utilities have an obligation to provide essential services to all residents in their service territory, and this currently includes both natural gas and electric service in most areas. The original intention was to ensure equitable access to all consumers, but this obligation can now pose a barrier to electrifying homes, neighborhoods, and the state in an efficient and just manner. Legislators, utilities, and other stakeholders are cautious about widespread decommissioning of natural gas infrastructure until there is a legal architecture in place to ensure that equitable, reliable, and sufficient service is maintained to all customers. We are recognized leaders in the legal and regulatory issues associated with the obligation to serve in California and this policy lab will work to develop solutions in concert with EJ groups and state legislators.  The LCFS is one of the key measures intended by California to drive innovation in reducing GHG emissions. This program was implemented in 2011 with the goal of stimulating a cellulosic biofuel industry and has been significantly amended over the past decade. Over the next year, the California Air Resources Board (ARB) will undertake a major revision of the program with large implications for biofuels, food crops, refineries and CAFOs. We have been asked by multiple environmental justice groups for assistance in developing EJ-centered technical and legal analysis to support their engagement in this process including development of and modeling of an &quot;EJ scenario&quot; to compare with alternatives developed by ARB.  We will conduct our work from the perspective of and informed by the needs of our clients, APEN and CBE, environmental justice organizations that are actively involved in resilience and decarbonization policy. In this course, students will learn the basics of building electrification and low carbon fuel standards as well as engage in work related to these policies that is directly tied to policy outcomes.  Lectures will focus on technical, economic and legal aspects of the challenge. In addition, students will work in groups on legal and technical analysis aimed at supporting better decision making in energy policy proposals in California. Students will work in partnership with postdocs and legal fellows on their group projects and may have the opportunity to present the results of their work to both APEN, CBE, legislators, and CPUC staff.  The course is intended for students interested in multi-disciplinary approaches to public policy problems. No background in either energy law or energy modeling is required.  Students will engage in weekly lecture and discussion of energy resilience and decarbonization science and policy, including student presentations and guest lectures by scientists, practitioners and policymakers who are true subject matter experts engaged in the policy processes student teams will be working on. Students will also meet outside of class once per week with the teaching team in working sessions to discuss progress on team projects.  Elements used in grading: Attendance, Performance, Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Paper. Students enrolled in Section 02 (with instructor consent) will be required to write an individual research paper meeting the Law School's R paper requirements.

The goal of the Spring 2023 policy lab is to develop a strategy for getting the information developed in the Fall 2022 policy lab to the field. In particular, students in the policy lab will identify how service providers and funders effectively receive information (offline through community-driven programs or online through websites and working with Google search and other engines) and specifically how they are obtaining information related to state abortion laws. The students will identify and speak with relevant legal and policy organizations to determine how they share legal information with funders and service providers. This &quot;market research&quot; will help inform (1) who our client should be and (2) what kind of materials (offline v. online) we should develop (what forms work best, how should the information be presented and executed?) In the last few weeks of the quarter, the students will propose and develop initial drafts of those materials.  Given that the terrain is rapidly changing, students will likely update the legal information collected by the Fall 2022 policy lab to ensure it remains accurate.

        "description": "The past decade has been defined by democratic backsliding and the reemergence of authoritarianism around the globe. Freedom House marked 2021 as the 18th consecutive year of global democratic decline, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing polarization, and rising inequality. In the face of such trends, what role can a healthy, independent judiciary play in halting the rise of anti-democratic leaders and preserving the rule of law?  Students enrolled in this policy lab will have the opportunity to investigate answers to this question by conducting comparative research on 21st century judicial reform efforts. Which nations have pursued innovative new strategies to improve the functioning of their judiciaries? Topics for research will include advances in judicial independence, vetting, appointment mechanisms, balance of power structures, constitutional review, access to justice, and other factors affecting the rule of law.  Students will have the opportunity to attend in-person talks and dinners with foreign Supreme Court and Constitutional Court Justices. (The lab has received grants to host these foreign justices at Stanford). Confirmed guests to the lab include current Magistrates or ex-Magistrates from the Colombian Constitutional Court, Peruvian Supreme Court, Costa Rican Supreme Court, Mexican Supreme Court, and Chilean Supreme Court. Students will be able to interview these foreign judges in small groups. Students will compile their findings, along with recommendations for future research and reform efforts, into a judicial reform database.  The lab will culminate with a field research trip to study reforms in Colombia. Students in past versions of the lab identified Colombia as potentially a successful model of judicial reforms. Specifically, Colombia's Constitutional Court has become one of the most recognized and powerful constitutional courts and, among other things, its appointment mechanism seems to promote judicial independence. Students enrolled in the lab can attend a week-long trip to Colombia in March 2023 to participate in meetings and in-depth interviews with judges, lawyers, and bureaucrats.  Throughout the quarter, students will survey the impact of a specific country's reforms on various stakeholders in the legal system, including judges, legal practitioners, and the public.  The lab can also sponsor smaller student/research trips to other Latin American countries, including Mexico, Peru, and Chile.

        "title": "Policy Practicum: Becoming the Tech Creator and Regulator: Redefining Insurance Solutions",
        "description": "Consumers are often faced with insurance policies that are lengthy, incomprehensible, and incredibly vague.  Whether it's healthcare, homeowners or auto insurance, people cannot easily determine the extent of coverage and risk represented in insurance contracts. The contracts alone do not express clearly whether they provide sufficient coverage to the individual and/or how to make use of them when a problem arises.  In this Policy Practicum, jointly hosted by Stanford CodeX and the Legal Design Lab, students will research and learn both theoretical foundations and practical tools to develop solutions that solve for transparency, accessibility, and literacy in the insurance industry.  Students will gather the technical knowledge of the industry, conduct client interviews, and learn design thinking and product management skills.  We will focus on the use case of revolutionizing the insurance ecosystem to address the aforementioned issues.  Students will first interview and understand our client's, NAIC, needs in addressing the insurance concerns of various constituents, and identify their most pressing and specific obstacles.  Students will act as creators -- in this role, they will learn skills on how to develop technologically driven solutions, gain an understanding of how to apply a suite of AI-driven applications, analyze legal information problems through the lens of computational law, and advise on how to best address clients' needs.  Students will also gain insight into methodologies in Science and Technology Studies (STS) to critically analyze their solutions, when they transition into their roles as regulators.  Technology-driven solutions are frequently developed in silos and do not have sufficient foresight around the unintended consequences. In applying an STS framework, they will evaluate their solution's policy implications: ethical, regulatory and legal standards; and fairness, accountability, and inclusivity measures.  The policy lab aims to help students  understand and contribute new insights and communities of practice on how to use, assess, develop, and iterate on technology-driven solutions that are &quot;future-conscious,&quot; - weighed against ethical, regulatory and legal concerns, to help address NAIC's challenges in the insurance industry. This class is open to Stanford law students, and available for cross-registration for engineering, computer science, and humanities students. Students will be working together in small teams.

        "title": "Policy Practicum:  Harvesting Climate Benefits from Climate-Smart Agricultural & Forestry Practices",
        "description": "BACKGROUND. As part of its climate agenda, the Biden Administration is promoting &quot;climate-smart&quot; agricultural and forestry practices that can advance climate goals by sequestering carbon and/or reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. See Executive Order 14008, Section 216(b). Significant funding is being allocated to this effort. The recently-enacted Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allocates nearly $20 billion to existing U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) conservation programs that are presumed to generate climate benefits. Significantly, however, the IRA conditions the funding upon a Secretarial &quot;determination&quot; that the funds will &quot;directly improve soil carbon, reduce nitrogen losses, or reduce, capture, avoid, or sequester carbon dioxide, methane, or nitrous oxide emissions.&quot; Separately, the USDA is moving forward with a $3.5 billion &quot;Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities&quot; program, which will test the proposition that when ag and forestry production practices generate discernable carbon benefits&iquest;as certified through an as-yet undefined process--farmers and foresters will be able to command higher market prices.  PROBLEM SET. There are no well-defined protocols for how to measure, monitor, report and verify (collectively referred to as &quot;MMRV&quot;) climate benefits associated with specific ag and forestry practices. Current survey techniques utilized by the USDA are imprecise, typically involve limited or no field testing and do not take advantage of newly available technologies. Developing solid MMRV muscle could generate multiple benefits, including: (1) providing a stronger rationale for paying farmers and foresters to deploy climate-smart practices; (2) enabling farmers and foresters to collect a market premium for commodities produced using climate-smart practices; and (3) setting sideboards that would improve the credibility of voluntary ag and forestry carbon markets. In addition to fundamental MMRV questions, no guidance has been developed, as yet, regarding closely-related requirements, including: (1) the criteria upon which a Secretarial &quot;determination&quot; of climate benefits will be made under IRA-funded programs; or (2) a market-recognized &quot;climate-smart&quot; certification that will be bestowed on commodities that have been produced using practices that generate climate benefits.  PRACTICUM FOCUS. The practicum will develop evidence-based recommendations to the White House and the Department of Agriculture regarding how to effectively address climate aspects of its climate-smart ag and forestry IRA funding, and how to deploy its new Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program to advance climate-related MMRV and commodity market opportunities for the ag and forestry sectors. Primary attention will be given to the identification of MMRV protocols in a rapidly-evolving technical context and how related policy determinations and certifications should be developed and potentially applied.  Agricultural practices were the primary focus for the winter quarter practicum. FORESTRY PRACTICES WILL BE THE PRIMARY FOCUS FOR THE COMPANION SPRING QUARTER PRACTICUM. (The practicum will be open to students through both the Law School and the Doerr Sustainability School. Research and policy development tasks undertaken in the practicum will include: (1) Identifying and critiquing current USDA MMRV protocols for climate-smart ag and forestry practices. (2) Gathering MMRV-related information pertinent to forestry practices from additional sources including: Private party proposals that the USDA has selected for funding under the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program. Voluntary carbon credit markets, where payments are based on forestry practices; Relevant RD&amp;D efforts underway in industry, academic institutions, and technology incubators. (3) Identifying and convening individuals that have expertise in carbon sequestration in agricultural practices and forests and forest soils and recommending mechanisms through which the USDA could tap their expertise on an on-going basis. (4) Developing criteria that the Secretary of Agriculture potentially could apply when making IRA-required &quot;determinations&quot; regarding climate benefits related to IRA-funded agricultural and forestry-related programs. (5) Evaluating a range of climate-smart commodities certification  approaches for agricultural and forest products that might be utilized, taking into account approaches that have been taken in other forestry contexts (e.g., forest stewardship certifications).

        "description": "The fight to curb climate change will be won or lost in emerging markets and developing economies -- particularly those in Southeast Asia -- in which surging energy consumption and infrastructure investment today will lock in carbon-emission patterns for decades. Policymakers and investors in these countries and in international development institutions have pledged, most recently at international climate talks in Egypt in November 2022, aggressive emission reductions and significant funding to achieve them. But the environmental efficacy of that investment will depend on how well the spending is calibrated to the realities of the political economies -- that is, the structures of power -- in the countries in question. In this research seminar, also known as a policy practicum, students will work closely with policymakers and investors in Indonesia and/or Vietnam, and with international finance officials focused on those countries, on research that will help inform key energy and energy-finance plans that are in the process of being crafted. The students' work will inform a series of workshops to be held with these players throughout 2023, and it will figure into writing submitted for publication. This work constitutes the next stage of a research program of the Stanford Climate of Infrastructure Project. The research earlier produced a peer-reviewed paper (on which students were named co-authors) illuminating patterns of international climate finance, and a variety of other writings.

        "description": "Policy Client: McCourt Institute, https://mccourtinstitute.org/. This policy lab will provide students an opportunity to learn about and write research reports concerning the governance of the newest technologies. The students will form three teams with each team producing one group report on one of the following technologies: (1) Blockchain (principally non-crypto applications); (2) virtual and extended reality; and (3) Generative AI (Chat GPT, Dall-E, etc.). There will be three classes on each topic -- one to describe the harms presented by the technology, another to investigate private governance solutions and best practices, and a final that will explore options for government regulation. The three group oral presentations and written reports will follow that same structure. The goal is to provide a blueprint for regulators and firms concerning governance of these new technologies. Students are expected to attend all classes. Students will consider the ethical implications of new technologies and the role of lawyers in mitigating risks for firms engaging in these new technologies. The class will be limited to 20 students -- at least half of whom will be law students. The other half will be comprised of graduate students and advanced undergraduates from disciplines across the university and who can demonstrate knowledge and background in the relevant technologies. The class will meet at the Law School on Mondays from 4:15 to 6:15 pm.  NOTE: Admission is with consent of the instructor. Interested students should submit a one-paragraph statement describing their background and interest in the class and the particular technology for their focus. Submit statements of interest using the form available at https://forms.gle/DMgc4GVEX6wdKKZNA. Students should also complete the consent application form available at https://registrar.law.stanford.edu. SKILLS TRAINING: Students who enroll in a Law and Policy Lab practicum for the first time are asked to participate in the full-day methods boot camp on the first Saturday of the term. If you wish to earn course credit for developing your policy analysis skills, you may formally enroll in &quot;Elements of Policy Analysis&quot; (Law 7846) for one-unit of additional credit. As you will see from the course description, credit for Law 7846 requires your attendance at the full-day methods boot camp plus at least two additional lunch-hour workshops. If you enroll in a practicum but prefer to audit the supplemental skills class -- rather than receive formal credit -- please let Policy Lab Program Director Luciana Herman (lherman@law.stanford.edu) know and she will contact you with more details.

        "description": "This policy lab project builds on Stanford Steyer-Taylor Center (STC) and Sustainable Finance Initiative (SFI) research and analysis on structuring effective carbon markets. It leverages related work and resources on campus, and engages with clients in the US government working to design effective US and International carbon markets.  Steyer-Taylor Center and Sustainable Finance Initiative researchers have identified five key pieces to structuring effective carbon markets:  (1) Carbon accounting for liabilities and assets in compliance and non-compliance markets; (2) scientific measurement issues covering quantity, duration and budgets; (3) property rights, mineral rights and legal issues underlying transactions; (4) market structure, securities, capital structures and trading infrastructure; and (5) regulation and the role of government actors.  Students will work in small teams to help develop this vision for coordinated carbon markets by researching and writing (1) a series of position papers covering the five topics listed above (a top-down approach); and (2) case studies of specific transactions (a bottom-up approach). Policy lab students may contribute generally to papers on the five topics or they may develop a case study on a specific transaction.  The project seeks graduate and upper-division students from law, public policy, economics, finance, environmental science, and the Graduate School of Business. Please email your questions to instructor Alicia Seiger (aseiger@stanford.edu).  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Performance, Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Paper.

        "title": "Policy Practicum: Corporate Performance Standards on Racial and Economic Equity",
        "description": "This policy lab practicum focuses on corporations and racial and economic equity. Students will work closely with the instructor and a client called PolicyLink (https://www.policylink.org/), which co-founded the Corporate Racial Equity Alliance (https://corporateracialequityalliance.org/).  Corporations have a critical and essential role to play in advancing racial and economic equity given their tremendous influence over economic, political, social, and cultural dimensions. Additionally, there is significant stakeholder demand for companies to stop perpetuating racial and economic inequalities. Establishing a common language and framework for businesses to advance racial and economic equity is a critical and urgently needed component of the transformation toward a just, equitable, and healthy society for all of us. Current corporate standards do not offer a clear or sufficiently comprehensive path on how to approach, measure, report, and motivate the achievement of racial and economic equity.  PolicyLink and others in the Corporate Racial Equity Alliance are developing new corporate performance standards to address this gap. These standards are on track for publication in early 2024.  Students will research the current reporting landscape (e.g., SEC disclosure rules) and map them to the standards. The results of their research will be reflected in the published corporate standards. This policy lab will give students an opportunity to learn about corporate governance, public disclosure rules, business practices, and the role of corporations in advancing racial and economic equity. Prior experience with business or corporate law is welcome but not necessary. Students will meet weekly to discuss research progress as well as related topics (e.g., ESG).  This policy lab seeks students from law school and is also available for cross-registration from students in graduate and professional degree programs in business, economics, finance, and management science.

        "title": "Policy Practicum: \"What's Next? After Students for Fair Admissions\"",
        "description": "Policy Client: Stanford Center for Racial Justice, https://law.stanford.edu/stanford-center-for-racial-justice/. The Supreme Court's decision in Students for Fair Admissions has upended nearly a half century of precedent. Universities that had long relied on race-based affirmative action in their admissions policies will no longer be permitted to do so.  This policy lab will take up the question with which universities across the country must now grapple: What next? The orientation of the lab will be forward-looking and inclined toward innovation. New principles. New goals. New ideas.  Rather than merely try to accomplish indirectly what the Supreme Court has prohibited universities from doing overtly, the practicum aims to treat the Supreme Court's prohibition of race-based affirmative action as an opportunity to reconsider more broadly the goals of selective college admissions and the ways in which America's leading educational institutions may reform admissions and associated practices in order to improve higher education broadly. Advanced education is crucially important both to national well-being and to racial justice. There is no path to racial justice that does not entail an educational system that works better for people of all backgrounds. The recent Supreme Court decisions regarding race preferences in admissions, and also student loan forgiveness, create an uncommon opportunity to fairly radically rethink how universities make good on their implicit bargain with the American people: to receive public patronage in exchange for enhancing educational opportunity and social mobility.  Two understandings of the issues inform the scope of work. One is that race-based affirmative action is far from the only aspect of university activity that has been or will be subject to criticism. Thus, we will not limit our focus to the one practice the Supreme Court has already prohibited. Rather, the entire array of marketing, recruitment, admissions and outreach practices and principles should be up for re-examination. The other important point to understand is that a school's admissions practices are connected to broader questions about the role of prestigious colleges and universities in American society. Only through engaging those broader questions can one think clearly about the normative aims that selective colleges and universities should seek to further, through admissions, financial aid and otherwise.  In considering the issues, the lab will squarely confront a salient feature of American higher education that has received too little attention: the extraordinary stratification of American colleges and universities. The institutions at the apex of the hierarchy are the envy of the world; they are wealthier, more influential, and more sought after than ever before in our history. Yet, they educate a minuscule percentage of all students, most of whom struggle at less well-resourced institutions, which themselves struggle financially among other operational and educational challenges. The lab will consider the extent to which this extreme stratification is incompatible with the educational needs of our nation and will explore and develop strategies to counter it.  The work product of the lab will be a guidance document for universities, policymakers, and stakeholders across the country that serves as a road map for how to promote learning and advance racial justice after Students for Fair Admissions. The report will synthesize and evaluate the most successful higher education reforms and offer robust analysis, innovative policy development and recommendations for how to forge better systems of learning for all students. Accomplishing this goal will require the participants in the lab to understand and assess a wide array of issues concerning the structure and goals of higher education, and to take arguments that emanate from conservatives as seriously as those that emanate from liberals.  Students in this policy lab will research, identify, and design strategies and policy solutions to entrenched racial inequities within our higher education system, particularly at our most elite universities. Students will take a multidisciplinary approach to problem solving in the lab, researching and interacting with a wide range of experts and relevant fields, including but not limited to government, law, business, education, psychology, sociology, health, and technology.  This class is open to Stanford Law School students, and available for cross-registration for undergraduate and graduate students from across campus. We highly encourage students from outside the Law School to apply, particularly students from the Graduate School of Education, the Graduate School of Business, and those interested in developing their design-thinking skills. Students will be working together in small teams. Grading will be based on presentations, class participation, group work, and written assignments, including a final paper. The long-term client for this policy lab is the Stanford Center for Racial Justice. Please note this lab is a fall quarter 3-unit commitment with the option for a winter quarter extension. The winter quarter extension is a variable 1-3 units.  CONSENT APPLICATION: To apply for this course, students must complete a Consent Application Form available at SLS Registrar https://registrar.law.stanford.edu/. Additionally, students must submit a resume, transcript, and brief policy exercise via email to Dionna Rangel at drangel@law.stanford.edu. Applications are due by Sunday, September 17 at 11:59 pm. Directions for the policy exercise are below.  POLICY EXERCISE: You are a senior advisor to the president of a small university that has relied on using race as a factor in their admissions process. The president has expressed major concerns about the implications for the school after the Supreme Court's decision to strike down affirmative action in Students for Fair Admissions. They have asked you to draft a policy memo to help them navigate the uncertainty brought on by this landmark decision, specifically: 1. Briefly summarize Students for Fair Admissions, including what the decision says is prohibited and what is permitted. 2. Identify potential avenues for the university to respond to the decision that might be worthy of further investigation, including innovative policy ideas and reforms but also anything the administration should be thinking about more broadly as a higher education institution. 3. Include a short bibliography of select readings that can help the president stay informed about the issues, ideas, and responses post-affirmative action. The memo should be no longer than two pages, single-spaced, and use 12-point font.  SKILLS TRAINING: Students who enroll in a Law and Policy Lab practicum for the first time are asked to participate in the full-day methods boot camp typically held on the first Saturday of the term. If you wish to earn course credit for developing your policy analysis skills, you may formally enroll in &quot;Elements of Policy Analysis&quot; (Law 7846) for one unit of additional credit.

What are the risks that AI poses for people seeking legal guidance, that technical and policy guardrails should mitigate?  In this course, students will conduct research to identify key opportunities and risks around AI's use by the public to deal with common legal problems like bad living conditions, possible evictions, debt collection, divorce, or domestic violence. Especially with the launch of new AI platforms like ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Bing Chat, more people may turn to generative AI platforms for guidance on their legal rights, options, and procedures.  How can technology companies, legal institutions, and community groups responsibly advance AI solutions to benefit people in need?  Students will explore these questions about AI and access to justice through hands-on interviews, fieldwork, and design workshops with different stakeholders throughout the justice system. They will run interview sessions online and on-site at courts, to hear from various community members about whether they would use AI for legal help and to brainstorm how the ideal AI system would behave. Students will also observe how participants use AI to respond to a fictional legal problem, to assess how the AI performs and understand how people regard the AI's guidance. Students will be required to complete ethical training for human subjects research, which takes approximately 2 hours through the CITI program online. They will then conduct community interviews according to an approved IRB research protocol.  Students will synthesize what they learn in these community interviews, observations, and brainstorm sessions, in a presentation to legal and technical experts. They will hold a multi-stakeholder workshop at to explore how their findings may contribute to technical and legal projects to develop responsible, human-centered AI in the legal domain. Students will develop skills in facilitating interdisciplinary policy discussions about how technology and regulation can be developed alongside each other.  The students&iquest; final report will contribute to policy and technology discussions about the principles, benchmarks, and risk typologies that can guide the ethical development of AI platforms for access to justice.  Students are asked to enroll in both Fall and Winter quarters of the class. The class may be extended to Spring quarter, depending on the issues raised.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Performance, Class Participation, and Written Assignments.

        "description": "Nearly 1200 people are incarcerated in female correctional facilities in California and are serving lengthy sentences for murder and manslaughter convictions. It is not known in California (or in any other state) how many of these individuals are incarcerated for crimes that directly relate to histories of intimate partner violence. The Stanford Criminal Justice Center, through its Regilla Project, is attempting to assess this frequency.  During Summer 2023, the Stanford Criminal Justice Center undertook data collection at the larger of the two women's prisons in California. The surveys were completed by individuals who have murder and manslaughter convictions to assess how their convictions were related to intimate partner violence. Nearly 500 individuals completed the survey during July 2023.  Students enrolled in the policy lab will code the narrative portions of the survey responses (not everyone who participated in the surveys completed a narrative portion), analyze the quantitative data collected through the surveys, and assist in drafting a report for researchers, policymakers and practitioners aimed to better understand the nature of who is incarcerated and what their needs are, and to suggest front-end policy reforms.  Application process: Interested students should submit a Consent of Instructor form (see Policy Lab Practicums webpage or https://registrar.law.stanford.edu/) with a copy of their resume, transcript, and statement of interest to Debbie Mukamal (dmukamal@law.stanford.edu) by September 11, 2023 at 5:00 pm. The statement of interest should indicate relevant expertise, including whether the student has any data analysis experience (quantitative and/or qualitative) as well as the type of software the student has used in such data analysis.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Performance, Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Paper.  Important note:  Admitted students may enroll for three units.

        "title": "Policy Practicum:  Evaluating Law Schools and Mental Health Disability",
        "description": "This policy lab maps the law school experience for students with psychiatric or mental health disabilities. It identifies barriers for people with psychiatric disabilities to envision themselves as lawyers, navigating the admissions process, flourishing in law school, and becoming successful licensed lawyers. Law school is a demanding experience, and lawyering is a challenging -- and inspiring -- profession. People with psychiatric disabilities face typical issues that many aspiring and actual lawyers may encounter. However, they also may experience obstacles of bias, unintended bureaucratic hurdles, absent accommodation structures or policies, or challenges due to their disability. Practicum students will conduct a literature review, legal research, and interviews to identify current best practices and needed missing resources. Students will look at the work of advocacy groups for disability, substance use disorder, and formerly incarcerated people, associations for law students and lawyers, programs and policies at ABA member law schools, and innovative programs on mental disability and academia across Stanford's campus. The practicum aims to delineate the law school process, its pinch points, and opportunities for change for people with psychiatric disabilities. The fall term is an initial step to map out difficulties with the current law school process. The ultimate goal of the practicum is policy recommendations for law schools and other key stakeholders to improve the process and successfully integrate people with psychiatric disabilities into the legal profession.  The class is open to Stanford law students and available for cross-registration for other Stanford students. Students with personal experience of psychiatric disability are encouraged to apply, but personal experience is not a requirement. It is intended for those interested in the intersectional and multi-disciplinary investigation of the legal profession and disability. Students will work in teams to produce an initial draft and an oral presentation to the class on a designated portion of the overall project. Additionally, the class will meet weekly to consider assigned reading material, meet interested parties, and discuss progress on team projects. Elements used in grading: Attendance, Class Performance, Class Participation, Written Assignments. This policy lab will be offered in future terms. We encourage students to participate in subsequent quarters if they can do so.

The Civil SEP allows students to (a) gain experience in a field where a clinical course is not offered, or (b) pursue advanced work in an area of prior clinical practice. Students may extern for 20, 24, 30, or 34 hours per week. For a complete description of the Civil SEP, students should read the Externship Handbook, which is available from the Levin Center for Public Service and Public Interest Law or online at: http://www.law.stanford.edu/organizations/programs-and-centers/john-and-terry-levin-center-for-public-service-and-public-interest-law/externship-program-0 . Students wishing to enroll in an externship must meet various requirements that are set out in the Handbook. Students participating in the Civil SEP must also concurrently enroll in the Externship Companion Seminar (Law 881). An externship that otherwise meets the criteria for obtaining EL credit will be approved for EL credit when the field placement provides specialized experience complementary to a student's intended career path and comparable benefits cannot be obtained through other EL coursework at Stanford.

Standards for approval of a SCEP placement are similar to those for Directed Research proposals, although they are higher. Because there is a preference for local civil and criminal SEP placements (see Law 882 and Law 883), your SCEP proposal must explain (a) how it meets the goals of the externship program; and (b) why a similar project cannot be accomplished in one of the placements offered in the Bay Area. SCEP placements outside the Bay Area must be full-time. Students wishing to undertake a SCEP placement obtain the supervision of a faculty member who will oversee their externship and an accompanying tutorial. For a full description of the SCEP, students should read the Externship Handbook, which is available from the Levin Center for Public Service and Public Interest Law or online at: http://www.law.stanford.edu/organizations/programs-and-centers/john-and-terry-levin-center-for-public-service-and-public-interest-law/externship-program-0.

        "title": "Community Law Clinic: Clinical Practice",
        "description": "Located off-campus in a community location at the border between Palo Alto and East Palo Alto, the Community Law Clinic is the closest thing to a traditional legal services office within the Mills Legal Clinic.  Serving low-income individuals throughout the neighborhoods near Stanford, CLC is fundamentally a trial practice clinic, practicing in three distinct, but intertwined subject areas: (1) housing, (2) social security disability and public benefits, and (3) post-conviction relief. In addition to its off-campus location, hallmarks of the CLC practice include extensive client contact, civil litigation skills (motion practice, oral advocacy, fact investigation), and the fast pace that comes from being responsible for several matters at once. Each student represents clients in all three practice areas, allowing for a diverse experience with clients, opponents, and other system-actors. Students may also participate in larger policy and legislative efforts in the relevant subject matters. CLC work emphasizes students' embodying the role of a lawyer (as opposed to a policymaker, judge, or intern) and the development of communication, collaboration, time management, cultural humility and other skills necessary for any professional setting. After intensive training in weeks 1 and 2, the clinic curriculum includes two group seminar sessions per week and a once/week student-led case rounds session. CLC's off-campus location affords students a feel for daily life in the communities surrounding the Stanford campus, and the opportunity to form a close-knit and collaborative learning environment.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses -- The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

        "title": "Community Law Clinic: Clinical Coursework",
        "description": "Located off-campus in a community location at the border between Palo Alto and East Palo Alto, the Community Law Clinic is the closest thing to a traditional legal services office within the Mills Legal Clinic.  Serving low-income individuals throughout the neighborhoods near Stanford, CLC is fundamentally a trial practice clinic, practicing in three distinct, but intertwined subject areas: (1) housing, (2) social security disability and public benefits, and (3) post-conviction relief. In addition to its off-campus location, hallmarks of the CLC practice include extensive client contact, civil litigation skills (motion practice, oral advocacy, fact investigation), and the fast pace that comes from being responsible for several matters at once. Each student represents clients in all three practice areas, allowing for a diverse experience with clients, opponents, and other system-actors. Students may also participate in larger policy and legislative efforts in the relevant subject matters. CLC work emphasizes students' embodying the role of a lawyer (as opposed to a policymaker, judge, or intern) and the development of communication, collaboration, time management, cultural humility and other skills necessary for any professional setting. After intensive training in weeks 1 and 2, the clinic curriculum includes two group seminar sessions per week and a once/week student-led case rounds session. CLC's off-campus location affords students a feel for daily life in the communities surrounding the Stanford campus, and the opportunity to form a close-knit and collaborative learning environment.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses -- The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

While the work is often challenging and sometimes heartbreaking, it offers students a unique opportunity to put their skills, intellect, and compassion to use by serving people in a moment of great need. The emotional challenges of the Clinic's work are addressed through an integrated self-care curriculum. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office or other locations as directed during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) that would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

        "description": "Students in the Criminal Defense Clinic become immersed in the world of indigent defense. Each student represents members of our community accused of crimes in the courts of Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties. Our state misdemeanor cases encompass a wide range of charges, such as drug use and possession, resisting arrest, and theft. Other state case assignments include working for people's pretrial release. Some quarters, our docket also includes federal cases in the Northern District of California.  Clinic students are their clients' primary legal representatives in and out of court. Under close faculty supervision, students undertake investigation, interview witnesses, engage in plea negotiations, draft motions, conduct evidentiary hearings, and make other court appearances. Persuasive writing with rigorous faculty edits is a major component of the clinic.  The Criminal Defense Clinic is an intensive, fast-paced, and demanding program of education and practical skills, taught through introductory training and ongoing workshops and skills practicums. The Clinic also addresses broader systemic issues such as implicit bias, immigration consequences, economic disparities, and addiction. The goal of the Clinic is to train students how to conduct a criminal case while engaging in thoughtful reflection and providing holistic representation. The Clinic's broader goal is to provide lawyering skills and habits of mind transferrable to any student's chosen field of practice. While the work is often challenging and sometimes heartbreaking, it offers students a unique opportunity to put their skills, intellect, and compassion to use by serving people in a moment of great need. The emotional challenges of the Clinic's work are addressed through an integrated self-care curriculum. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units.

        "description": "The six students enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic advocate before the San Jose Superior Court under the guidance of Santa Clara County prosecutors and Professor George Fisher. Students formulate case strategy, identify and interview witnesses, and conduct evidentiary motions, preliminary hearings, and occasional nonjury trials. Their cases concern thefts, burglaries, assaults, weapons possession, drunk driving, drug distribution, and a range of other crimes. Students offer testimony by police officers, crime victims, and other witnesses and cross-examine defense witnesses, including those defendants who take the stand.  Clinic students spend at least four full days a week--Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays--at the D.A.'s office or in court. There generally will be two class sessions each week: a three- or four-hour on-campus class on Wednesday mornings and a weekly lunch seminar at the D.A.'s office. Toward the beginning of the term, classes focus on skills training, including direct and cross-examination, admission of physical evidence, making and answering objections, and argument. Toward the end of the term, our classroom focus shifts to an examination and critique of the local mechanisms of criminal justice. Topics include the impact of race and class on the quality of justice; the institutional strengths and weaknesses of the actors in the system; prison conditions and prison reform; and the ethical issues that confront prosecutors and defense lawyers. Students typically tour San Quentin State Prison, FCI-Dublin (a federal women's prison), and the Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility in Stockton and have the option to spend an evening on a police ride-along. Students must submit regular written reflections on their experiences in and observations of the local justice system. Their assigned cases often will demand written court filings. During most weeks students will meet one-on-one with the faculty supervisor.  Evidence is a prerequisite. Courses in criminal procedure (investigation) and trial advocacy are strongly encouraged. Students will be awarded three separate grades, each reflecting four credits, for clinical practice, clinical methods, and clinical coursework. Elements used in grading include class attendance and participation, writing assignments, case preparation, and courtroom presentations and advocacy. Class attendance is mandatory. Grading is on the H/P system.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses: All of the Law School's clinical courses, other than advanced clinics, are offered fulltime for twelve credits. This format allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without having to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams, and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic may not enroll in any other class, seminar, directed research, or other credit-yielding activity within the Law School or University during their clinical quarter. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants expected to attend a daytime class regularly. There is a limited exception for joint-degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved case by case.  The clinical quarter begins on the first day of classes and runs through the final day of exam period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday-to-Friday workweek without permission from onsite and faculty supervisors. Students are expected to be available by email or cellphone during workday hours Monday through Friday and are expected to devote at least thirty-five hours per week to various facets of this work. In some weeks casework may demand much longer hours.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding: Once a student has applied to and been selected by a clinic, the student may not drop the course except in rare cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (fulltime or advanced) that would result in their earning more than twenty-seven clinical credits during their law school careers.

Clinic students spend at least four full days a week--Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays--at the D.A.'s office or in court. There generally will be two class sessions each week: a three- or four-hour on-campus class on Wednesday mornings and a weekly lunch seminar at the D.A.'s office. Toward the beginning of the term, classes focus on skills training, including direct and cross-examination, admission of physical evidence, making and answering objections, and argument. Toward the end of the term, our classroom focus shifts to an examination and critique of the local mechanisms of criminal justice. Topics include the impact of race and class on the quality of justice; the institutional strengths and weaknesses of the actors in the system; prison conditions and prison reform; and the ethical issues that confront prosecutors and defense lawyers. Students typically tour San Quentin State Prison, FCI-Dublin (a federal women's prison), and the Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility in Stockton and have the option to spend an evening on a police ride-along. Students must submit regular written reflections on their experiences in and observations of the local justice system. Their assigned cases often will demand written court filings. During most weeks students will meet one-on-one with the faculty supervisor.  Evidence is a prerequisite. Courses in criminal procedure (investigation) and trial advocacy are strongly encouraged. Students will be awarded three separate grades, each reflecting four credits, for clinical practice, clinical methods, and clinical coursework. Elements used in grading include class attendance and participation, writing assignments, case preparation, and courtroom presentations and advocacy. Class attendance is mandatory. Grading is on the H/P system.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses: All of the Law School's clinical courses, other than advanced clinics, are offered fulltime for twelve credits. This format allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without having to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams, and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic may not enroll in any other class, seminar, directed research, or other credit-yielding activity within the Law School or University during their clinical quarter. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants expected to attend a daytime class regularly. There is a limited exception for joint-degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved case by case.  The clinical quarter begins on the first day of classes and runs through the final day of exam period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday-to-Friday workweek without permission from onsite and faculty supervisors. Students are expected to be available by email or cellphone during workday hours Monday through Friday and are expected to devote at least thirty-five hours per week to various facets of this work. In some weeks casework may demand much longer hours.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding: Once a student has applied to and been selected by a clinic, the student may not drop the course except in rare cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (fulltime or advanced) that would result in their earning more than twenty-seven clinical credits during their law school careers.

        "title": "Environmental Law Clinic: Clinical Practice",
        "description": "Students enrolled in the Clinic provide legal assistance to national, regional and grassroots non-profit organizations on a variety of environmental issues, with a focus on complex natural resource conservation and biodiversity matters at the interface of law, science and policy. Working under the direct supervision of practicing environmental attorneys, Clinic students help screen new matters and potential clients; formulate strategies; research and develop factual and legal issues; and prosecute administrative and litigation proceedings.  During the term, students may meet with clients, opposing counsel or agency decision-makers; review and prepare administrative records; develop expert testimony; draft comment letters, petitions, pleading or briefs; and/or attend and present arguments in administrative and court hearings. In regular one-on-one meetings with supervising faculty, there is a heavy emphasis on learning how to write persuasively and present oral arguments. Indeed, in any given quarter, our students typically prepare a mix of state and federal, and trial and appellate, court pleadings, and because all of our hearings during the academic year are conducted by students, many students also have the opportunity to present oral argument in front of one or more judges. In addition, students participate in a regular seminar where we examine strategic, ethical and substantive issues arising out of the Clinic's work. The Clinic is a particularly good place to learn how to conduct effective legal research, marshal facts in support of legal arguments, and, above all, write well.  We practice at all levels of state and federal court and before many local, state and federal administrative agencies. Our work involves extensive motions practice and brief writing, and often involves administrative petitions and policy papers. Our work is inherently cross-disciplinary. No prior environmental experience or background is necessary, but an interest in learning about environmental and natural resources law is important.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

        "description": "Students enrolled in the Clinic provide legal assistance to national, regional and grassroots non-profit organizations on a variety of environmental issues, with a focus on complex natural resource conservation and biodiversity matters at the interface of law, science and policy. Working under the direct supervision of practicing environmental attorneys, Clinic students help screen new matters and potential clients; formulate strategies; research and develop factual and legal issues; and prosecute administrative and litigation proceedings.  During the term, students may meet with clients, opposing counsel or agency decision-makers; review and prepare administrative records; develop expert testimony; draft comment letters, petitions, pleading or briefs; and/or attend and present arguments in administrative and court hearings. In regular one-on-one meetings with supervising faculty, there is a heavy emphasis on learning how to write persuasively and present oral arguments. Indeed, in any given quarter, our students typically prepare a mix of state and federal, and trial and appellate, court pleadings, and because all of our hearings during the academic year are conducted by students, many students also have the opportunity to present oral argument in front of one or more judges. In addition, students participate in a regular seminar where we examine strategic, ethical and substantive issues arising out of the Clinic's work. The Clinic is a particularly good place to learn how to conduct effective legal research, marshal facts in support of legal arguments, and, above all, write well.  We practice at all levels of state and federal court and before many local, state and federal administrative agencies. Our work involves extensive motions practice and brief writing, and often involves administrative petitions and policy papers. Our work is inherently cross-disciplinary. No prior environmental experience or background is necessary, but an interest in learning about environmental and natural resources law is important.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.

        "description": "The Immigrants' Rights Clinic offers students the opportunity to represent immigrants before the San Francisco Immigration Court, the Board of Immigration Appeals, the federal district courts and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Students in the clinic conduct mini-trials in immigration court, write motions and appellate briefs, interview clients and witnesses, investigate facts, develop case strategy, and argue cases. The Clinic represents immigrants with past criminal convictions, asylum seekers, and survivors of domestic violence. All clinic students also work on a variety of impact litigation and advocacy projects to address federal government immigration enforcement practices at the national and local levels, including impact litigation to challenge prolonged immigration detention, local and state advocacy to limit enforcement activity by police, the creation of model pleadings and know your rights materials for immigrant detainees, and advocacy with the federal agencies that regulate immigration. No prior substantive experience or background in immigration or immigrants' rights work is necessary. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

        "title": "Immigrants' Rights Clinic: Clinical Coursework",
        "description": "The Immigrants' Rights Clinic offers students the opportunity to represent immigrants before the San Francisco Immigration Court, the Board of Immigration Appeals, the federal district courts and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Students in the clinic conduct mini-trials in immigration court, write motions and appellate briefs, interview clients and witnesses, investigate facts, develop case strategy, and argue cases. The Clinic represents immigrants with past criminal convictions, asylum seekers, and survivors of domestic violence. All clinic students also work on a variety of impact litigation and advocacy projects to address federal government immigration enforcement practices at the national and local levels, including impact litigation to challenge prolonged immigration detention, local and state advocacy to limit enforcement activity by police, the creation of model pleadings and know your rights materials for immigrant detainees, and advocacy with the federal agencies that regulate immigration. No prior substantive experience or background in immigration or immigrants' rights work is necessary. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Elements used in grading: Attendance and participation in class, case and project work and writing assignments. There are no prerequisites.",

        "title": "International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic: Clinical Practice",
        "description": "In the past half-century, human rights advocates have transformed a marginal utopian ideal into a central element of global discourse and practice. This Clinic gives students the opportunity to work directly with the actors and organizations behind this remarkable development as they navigate the vast challenges faced by human rights advocates and victims. In addition to operating within the human rights framework, students will also have occasion to study and contribute to efforts to resolve situations of tension and ongoing conflict using tools of transitional justice and conflict mitigation. The course aims to help students develop a broad range of multidisciplinary human rights advocacy skills--including factual documentation; litigation before national, regional, and international institutions; community empowerment strategies; and client enfranchisement and representation--through in-class sessions, role play exercises, and engagement in, and critical assessment of, clinical projects in human rights.  This Clinic involves both a weekly seminar as well as work directly with clients and partner organizations (i.e. Clinic Projects). Together, these experiences give students the chance to reflect upon a number of foundational questions including: What are the origins of the human rights movement and where is it headed? What does it mean to be a human rights activist? What are the main challenges and dilemmas facing those engaged in rights promotion and defense? How is conflict resolution consistent with human rights advocacy? When and where are these approaches in tension?  Students will also be confronted with the ethical and strategic issues that arise in the course of doing human rights work and balancing the often differing agendas of western international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and their counterparts in the (frequently non-western) developing world. In some sessions, part of the class will be devoted to presentations by students and clinical rounds in line with greater Mills Legal Clinic model. These presentations will consider one or more issues that arise in the course of students' own engagement in advocacy projects through the Clinic. During the course of the quarter, in addition to their work for their clients and partners, students will also be required to write several short, critical reflection papers or thought pieces (2-4 pages, double-spaced, or 500-1,000 words) on the readings, their Clinic Project(s), and/or human rights events on campus.

Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend inter-clinic group sessions.  Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical work product (i.e., the students' substantive contributions); clinical methods (which includes consideration of the students' lawyering skills, leadership, and professionalism); and clinical coursework (which focuses on the students' seminar participation, simulations, and reflection papers). Grading is pursuant to the H/P system. Elements used in grading include: Attendance, class participation, written assignments, professionalism, ability to work with others successfully, creative thinking, peer review, and commitment to the clinical enterprise.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and the clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.",

        "title": "International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic: Clinical Coursework",
        "description": "In the past half-century, human rights advocates have transformed a marginal utopian ideal into a central element of global discourse and practice. This Clinic gives students the opportunity to work directly with the actors and organizations behind this remarkable development as they navigate the vast challenges faced by human rights advocates and victims. In addition to operating within the human rights framework, students will also have occasion to study and contribute to efforts to resolve situations of tension and ongoing conflict using tools of transitional justice and conflict mitigation. The course aims to help students develop a broad range of multidisciplinary human rights advocacy skills--including factual documentation; litigation before national, regional, and international institutions; community empowerment strategies; and client enfranchisement and representation--through in-class sessions, role play exercises, and engagement in, and critical assessment of, clinical projects in human rights.  This Clinic involves both a weekly seminar as well as work directly with clients and partner organizations (i.e. Clinic Projects). Together, these experiences give students the chance to reflect upon a number of foundational questions including: What are the origins of the human rights movement and where is it headed? What does it mean to be a human rights activist? What are the main challenges and dilemmas facing those engaged in rights promotion and defense? How is conflict resolution consistent with human rights advocacy? When and where are these approaches in tension?  Students will also be confronted with the ethical and strategic issues that arise in the course of doing human rights work and balancing the often differing agendas of western international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and their counterparts in the (frequently non-western) developing world. In some sessions, part of the class will be devoted to presentations by students and clinical rounds in line with greater Mills Legal Clinic model. These presentations will consider one or more issues that arise in the course of students' own engagement in advocacy projects through the Clinic. During the course of the quarter, in addition to their work for their clients and partners, students will also be required to write several short, critical reflection papers or thought pieces (2-4 pages, double-spaced, or 500-1,000 words) on the readings, their Clinic Project(s), and/or human rights events on campus. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses. The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. As a general rule, students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work/projects (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend inter-clinic group sessions.  Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical work product (i.e., the students' substantive contributions); clinical methods (which includes consideration of the students' lawyering skills, leadership, and professionalism); and clinical coursework (which focuses on the students' seminar participation, simulations, and reflection papers). Grading is pursuant to the H/P system. Elements used in grading include: Attendance, class participation, written assignments, professionalism, ability to work with others successfully, creative thinking, peer review, and commitment to the clinical enterprise.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and the clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled.

        "description": "The Juelsgaard Intellectual Property and Innovation Clinic provides students the opportunity to help shape the course and outcome of significant legal and policy debates before courts, regulatory bodies, legislators, and other policy makers. Students in the clinic engage in hands-on representation of clients in cutting-edge matters involving IP (copyright, patent, and trademark) and other laws and technology policy that affect innovation, such as online speech and content moderation, antitrust, pharmaceutical regulation, privacy, cybersecurity, net neutrality, and more. They draft amicus briefs for the Supreme Court or federal appellate and district courts, or pursue litigation in district court, or submit detailed comments and live testimony in rulemaking proceedings before the FCC, Copyright Office, PTO, FDA, FTC, and other agencies. Students also provide counseling and legal advice to help their clients solve complex tech, IP or other innovation-related legal, technical, and business problems. Students may draft public-facing policy whitepapers or &quot;best practices&quot; documents to influence tech policy in ways that benefit innovators and innovation. Throughout the quarter, clinic student engage with and seek to understand the role that race, racism, and structural inequality play in the development, deployment, use, and regulation of technology, and advocate for antiracist policies, laws, and regulations.  Our clients are non-profits and advocacy organizations; groups of innovators, entrepreneurs, technology users/consumers, legal academics, computer scientists, or technologists; or sometimes individual entrepreneurs, startups, biohackers, media critics, or open-source advocates, among others. Students' work ranges across tech areas such as internet/information technology, biotech, pharmaceuticals, and online speech and media. Our policy advocacy will often involve intertwined factual, technological, business, economic, political and public relations considerations along with the substantive legal issues. Students in the clinic may be called upon to collaborate with technologists, researchers, doctors, economists, social scientists, industry experts, and others to develop and articulate the appropriate advocacy for their clients. The bi-weekly clinic seminar focuses on student-led workshops regarding client projects, and on engaging with current thinking around race, technology, and the legal system; innovation and innovation economics; and the impact of IP, antitrust, and other law and regulation on innovation. Students will critically examine the role of lawyers advocating for the public interest, for racial justice and reforms to the legal system, and for sound and sensible innovation policy outcomes. A background in technology may be useful in some cases but is not necessary to a successful experience in the clinic.--Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses -- The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units.

Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system.

        "description": "The Juelsgaard Intellectual Property and Innovation Clinic provides students the opportunity to help shape the course and outcome of significant legal and policy debates before courts, regulatory bodies, legislators, and other policy makers. Students in the clinic engage in hands-on representation of clients in cutting-edge matters involving IP (copyright, patent, and trademark) and other laws and technology policy that affect innovation, such as online speech and content moderation, antitrust, pharmaceutical regulation, privacy, cybersecurity, net neutrality, and more. They draft amicus briefs for the Supreme Court or federal appellate and district courts, or pursue litigation in district court, or submit detailed comments and live testimony in rulemaking proceedings before the FCC, Copyright Office, PTO, FDA, FTC, and other agencies. Students also provide counseling and legal advice to help their clients solve complex tech, IP or other innovation-related legal, technical, and business problems. Students may draft public-facing policy whitepapers or &quot;best practices&quot; documents to influence tech policy in ways that benefit innovators and innovation. Throughout the quarter, clinic student engage with and seek to understand the role that race, racism, and structural inequality play in the development, deployment, use, and regulation of technology, and advocate for antiracist policies, laws, and regulations.  Our clients are non-profits and advocacy organizations; groups of innovators, entrepreneurs, technology users/consumers, legal academics, computer scientists, or technologists; or sometimes individual entrepreneurs, startups, biohackers, media critics, or open-source advocates, among others. Students' work ranges across tech areas such as internet/information technology, biotech, pharmaceuticals, and online speech and media. Our policy advocacy will often involve intertwined factual, technological, business, economic, political and public relations considerations along with the substantive legal issues. Students in the clinic may be called upon to collaborate with technologists, researchers, doctors, economists, social scientists, industry experts, and others to develop and articulate the appropriate advocacy for their clients. The bi-weekly clinic seminar focuses on student-led workshops regarding client projects, and on engaging with current thinking around race, technology, and the legal system; innovation and innovation economics; and the impact of IP, antitrust, and other law and regulation on innovation. Students will critically examine the role of lawyers advocating for the public interest, for racial justice and reforms to the legal system, and for sound and sensible innovation policy outcomes. A background in technology may be useful in some cases but is not necessary to a successful experience in the clinic.--Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses -- The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.

        "description": "The O&amp;T Clinic is Stanford's only corporate experiential course involving representation of real clients. We're designed for both students interested in M&amp;A, capital markets, emerging company, tech transactions or other corporate work, and those wanting to explore a non-litigation, advisory-oriented practice. Prior experience in business or corporate law is welcome but not necessary. Students represent multiple clients during the term. Our clients are all established nonprofit corporations. Most generate annual revenues in the range of $1 - $100 million, and some are larger. These clients have boards of directors, run complex programs, own brands and other intellectual property, and engage in a range of transactions, yet are small enough that our contact is almost always the CEO, CFO, general counsel, or other senior executive. O&amp;T client engagements provide students with opportunities to assess facts; develop advice; read and write contracts, corporate governance materials, emails and other client communications; lead meetings and calls with clients; collaborate with colleagues; and manage projects. Our practice is document-intensive and service-oriented; we focus on clear communication and crisp execution. Students also see the many ways corporate lawyers can carry out pro bono work. The course includes a class that meets twice a week. Class meetings center on student-led workshops regarding client projects and on orientation to corporate practice, including discussion of core commercial relationships such as acquisition, credit, and licensing, and practice skills such as transaction planning and management. Guests often join us; those are occasions for informal conversations with in-house counsels, law firm partners, and other experts. Information about prior projects is available from the instructors and on the SLS website. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Elements used in grading: The syllabus sets out specific evaluation criteria in supporting student development and evaluating student performance. These criteria are organized into the following categories: figuring things out; working with documents; working with other people; executing crisply; and learning and getting better.",

        "description": "The Religious Liberty Clinic is the leading clinic of its kind in the country. The landmark program offers participating students a full-time, first-chair experience representing a diverse group of clients in legal disputes arising from a wide range of beliefs, practices, and circumstances. Students learn in class and engage through reflective and supervised practice the laws, norms, and limits affecting the exercise of religious freedom in a pluralistic society. Students are expected to counsel individual or institutional clients and litigate on their behalf with excellence, professionalism, and maturity. In clinic, students typically handle an accommodation project - e.g., represent a prisoner, student, or employee facing obstacles in the exercise of faith - as well as a longer-term litigation or development matter - e.g., represent a small church, synagogue, or mosque with zoning issues, or an individual challenging state preferences for particular beliefs. Opportunities to draft amicus briefs also arise. The clinic involves agency, trial, and appellate practice - though time constraints may not permit each student to work in all areas - under the empowering supervision of faculty and staff. Students work in assigned case teams but are also encouraged to help develop new clients and matters.

        "description": "The Religious Liberty Clinic is the leading clinic of its kind in the country. The landmark program offers participating students a full-time, first-chair experience representing a diverse group of clients in legal disputes arising from a wide range of beliefs, practices, and circumstances. Students learn in class and engage through reflective and supervised practice the laws, norms, and limits affecting the exercise of religious freedom in a pluralistic society. Students are expected to counsel individual or institutional clients and litigate on their behalf with excellence, professionalism, and maturity. In clinic, students typically handle an accommodation project - e.g., represent a prisoner, student, or employee facing obstacles in the exercise of faith - as well as a longer-term litigation or development matter - e.g., represent a small church, synagogue, or mosque with zoning issues, or an individual challenging state preferences for particular beliefs. Opportunities to draft amicus briefs also arise. The clinic involves agency, trial, and appellate practice - though time constraints may not permit each student to work in all areas - under the empowering supervision of faculty and staff. Students work in assigned case teams but are also encouraged to help develop new clients and matters.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions.  Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled.  For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

        "title": "Supreme Court Litigation Clinic: Clinical Practice",
        "description": "The Supreme Court Litigation Clinic will expose students to the joys and frustrations of litigation before the Supreme Court of the United States. The bulk of the clinic will be run as a small law firm working on live cases before the Court. Students will participate in drafting petitions for certiorari and oppositions, merits briefs, and amicus briefs, compiling joint appendices, and preparing advocates for oral argument, as well as commenting (the technical term is &quot;kibbitzing&quot;) on drafts of briefs being filed by lawyers in other cases. The precise nature of the cases will depend on the Court's docket, but in recent Terms, the clinic's cases have involved federal criminal law and procedure, habeas corpus, constitutional and statutory antidiscrimination and employment law, bankruptcy law, and the First Amendment. Our aim is to involve students as fully as possible in this type of litigation.  The Clinic begins with an intensive introduction to the distinctive nature of Supreme Court practice, including the key differences between merits arguments and the certiorari process, the role of amicus briefs, and the Supreme Court Rules. After that, seminar meetings will be devoted primarily to collaborative work on the cases the clinic is handling. While students will be primarily responsible for working in teams on one case at a time, they will also be expected to acquire familiarity with the issues raised in other students' cases and will both edit each others' substantive work and assist each other and the instructors with the technical production work attendant on filing briefs with the Supreme Court. The course will involve substantial amounts of legal research.  The Supreme Court operates on a tight, and unyielding deadline, and students must be prepared both to complete their own work in a timely fashion and to assist one another and the instructors on other cases. The instructors will not ask students to do any kind of &quot;grunt work&quot; that they themselves will not also be handling, but grunt work there will be: proofreading, cite-checking, dealing with the joint appendix, and the like. The nature of the work product means that while students will average thirty hours per week on their case-related work, that work will surely be distributed unevenly across the quarter. Unlike most other courts, the Supreme Court has no student practice rules. Thus, students will not be able to argue cases before the Court. But they will participate in moot courts on their cases, as both advocates and Justices. Each student will also have the opportunity to travel to Washington to see the Court in session, preferably with respect to a case on which the student has worked. Ideally students will already have experience with persuasive doctrinal writing, through a course like Federal Pretrial Litigation or through intensive supervision during their summer jobs or other clinics. Admission to the Clinic is by consent of the instructors. Students will need to submit a writing sample that reflects their facility with doctrinal legal arguments and the name of at least one reference who can comment on their legal analytic ability.  - - Special instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

        "title": "Supreme Court Litigation Clinic: Clinical Coursework",
        "description": "The Supreme Court Litigation Clinic will expose students to the joys and frustrations of litigation before the Supreme Court of the United States. The bulk of the clinic will be run as a small law firm working on live cases before the Court. Students will participate in drafting petitions for certiorari and oppositions, merits briefs, and amicus briefs, compiling joint appendices, and preparing advocates for oral argument, as well as commenting (the technical term is &quot;kibbitzing&quot;) on drafts of briefs being filed by lawyers in other cases. The precise nature of the cases will depend on the Court's docket, but in recent Terms, the clinic's cases have involved federal criminal law and procedure, habeas corpus, constitutional and statutory antidiscrimination and employment law, bankruptcy law, and the First Amendment. Our aim is to involve students as fully as possible in this type of litigation.  The Clinic begins with an intensive introduction to the distinctive nature of Supreme Court practice, including the key differences between merits arguments and the certiorari process, the role of amicus briefs, and the Supreme Court Rules. After that, seminar meetings will be devoted primarily to collaborative work on the cases the clinic is handling. While students will be primarily responsible for working in teams on one case at a time, they will also be expected to acquire familiarity with the issues raised in other students' cases and will both edit each others' substantive work and assist each other and the instructors with the technical production work attendant on filing briefs with the Supreme Court. The course will involve substantial amounts of legal research.  The Supreme Court operates on a tight, and unyielding deadline, and students must be prepared both to complete their own work in a timely fashion and to assist one another and the instructors on other cases. The instructors will not ask students to do any kind of &quot;grunt work&quot; that they themselves will not also be handling, but grunt work there will be: proofreading, cite-checking, dealing with the joint appendix, and the like. The nature of the work product means that while students will average thirty hours per week on their case-related work, that work will surely be distributed unevenly across the quarter. Unlike most other courts, the Supreme Court has no student practice rules. Thus, students will not be able to argue cases before the Court. But they will participate in moot courts on their cases, as both advocates and Justices. Each student will also have the opportunity to travel to Washington to see the Court in session, preferably with respect to a case on which the student has worked. Ideally students will already have experience with persuasive doctrinal writing, through a course like Federal Pretrial Litigation or through intensive supervision during their summer jobs or other clinics. Admission to the Clinic is by consent of the instructors. Students will need to submit a writing sample that reflects their facility with doctrinal legal arguments and the name of at least one reference who can comment on their legal analytic ability.  - - Special instructions:  General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers.  Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system. -- Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. --The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled.

        "description": "The Youth and Education Advocacy Clinic offers students the opportunity to participate in a wide variety of educational rights and reform work, including direct representation of youth and families in special education and school discipline matters, community outreach and education, school reform litigation, and/or strategic policy research and consulting. All students will have an opportunity to represent elementary and high school students with disabilities in special education proceedings, to represent students in school discipline proceedings, or to work with coalitions and/or other education-sector agencies to advance equity-minded educational policies and school reform. Students working on special education matters will have the opportunity to handle all aspects of their clients' cases. Students working in this area will interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, work with medical and mental health professionals and experts, conduct legal and educational research, create case plans, and represent clients at individual education program (IEP) team meetings, mediation or special education due process hearings. This work will offer students a chance to study the relationship between individual special education advocacy and system-wide reform efforts such as impact litigation. Students working on school discipline matters will interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, interview witnesses, conduct legal and educational research, create case plan, and represent clients at school discipline hearings such as expulsion hearings. Such hearings provide the opportunity to present oral and written argument, examine witnesses, and present evidence before a hearing officer. If appropriate and necessary, such proceedings also present the opportunity to represent students on appeal before the school district board of trustees or the county board of education. Students may also have the opportunity to participate in complex school reform litigation, including the monitoring and enforcement of a consent decree and corrective action plan in an ongoing special education lawsuit or appellate and trial work in a pathbreaking educational rights case on behalf of Native American students. Finally, students who are interested in strategic policy research and management consulting on behalf of public education institutional clients (school districts, charter schools, state education agencies) will have the opportunity to participate in the multi-disciplinary collaborations with non-profit clients. The education clinic includes a one-week intensive training program held at the beginning of the quarter, weekly seminars that focus on legal skills and issues in law and education policy, regular case review, and a many opportunities for feedback and reflection with the instructors. Admission is by consent of instructor. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses -- The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. -- Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. -- Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period.

        "description": "There is more focus today on antitrust enforcement and competition policy than at any point in recent memory. This two-credit advanced antitrust seminar, taught by Obama's Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust (2013-16), examines topics that have the current attention of the courts, enforcers, academicians, elected officials and the public: Is the consumer welfare standard the right measure for determining injury to consumers and competition in a 21st Century economy?  Is the Chicago School preference for erring on the side of underenforcement justified? Did the Supreme Court in American Express get it right in analyzing anticompetitive effects in two-sided platforms? Are the current allegations of monopoly maintenance by Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple meritorious or simply an effort by others to punish success? Does current merger law adequately address the competitive consequences of acquisitions of nascent competitors by dominant firms and the risks associated with vertical acquisitions by dominant firms? How should the courts balance the rights of holders of standard essential patents against those of implementors? Which of the antitrust reforms being debated in Congress make sense? Expect guest appearances from one or more practitioners knowledgeable about these issues. This course is open to anyone who has taken Antitrust Law 1001 and to others with permission of the instructor. Enrollment is limited to 16 students.  Elements used in grading: class participation, including helping lead one of the discussion topics, and a 10-15 page paper picking an issue discussed in the seminar and arguing a side.

Yet despite the common attributes of the corporation familiar to every U.S. law student, corporations around the world have diverse ownership structures, interact in their domestic political economies in different ways, and exhibit a host of traits that vary with the institutional context in which they operate. This seminar explores the many forms corporate capitalism takes around the world, the forces that shape domestic corporate law and governance in major countries, and the important legal and policy issues raised by global corporate activity. We will explore the rise of &quot;agency capitalism&quot; in the U.S. and the proliferation of new forms of corporate ownership around the world, the emergence of Chinese state capitalism and its legal and policy consequences, efforts to reform Japanese stakeholder-oriented capitalism, and the emergence of hybrid forms of business organization designed to pursue both profits and social benefits. Policy issues to be considered include the &quot;social responsibility&quot; or &quot;purpose&quot; of the corporation, the national security implications of foreign investment by state-owned enterprises, and the consequences of global hedge fund activism.

While transactions should be tailored to the goals and circumstances of each set of parties, there are general principles that guide the design process, even as the technology of contracting is evolving (through automated and smart contracting). This seminar combines discussion of academic scholarship with examples of real-world examples of design challenges (such as in franchising, construction, corporate acquisition, loan or data use agreements). Students will be required to write and present a paper, and encouraged to focus on a specific contracting challenge.

Advanced Corporate Finance introduces these topics by lecture and then explores them through detailed analysis of actual cases. This structure maximizes the synergy between theory and practice, providing students with portable, durable, and marketable tools for their careers. Legal considerations that arise in the execution of these corporate financial decisions include mandatory disclosure requirements, the issuance of dual class shares, charges of anticompetitive practices, taxation, appraisal cases and fairness opinions, takeover defenses and fiduciary duty challenges, contractual provisions in merger agreements, insider trading, and Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. This class rigorously advances both conceptual and practical/analytical understanding. The knowledge gained will facilitate professional dealings with chief executive officers and chief financial officers, boards of directors, investment bankers, consultants, portfolio and investment managers, venture capitalists, and private equity investors.

We will examine reorganization through several stages of a business turnaround and restructuring (such as an out-of-court workout, a Chapter 11 filing, selected Chapter 11 operating issues, and the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization). We will also consider a few controversial issues that test the boundaries of bankruptcy law. For example, should a debtor have virtually unfettered discretion to choose any district (or any judge) for its Chapter 11 case?  To what extent does Chapter 11 provide an appropriate forum to resolve mass tort claims?  Can a Chapter 11 plan provide for a non-consensual settlement and release of claims held by one third-party against another third-party? Along the way we will touch on topics that often arise in a reorganization setting such as valuation, leveraged buyouts, and distressed debt investing. We will also follow current developments in actual Chapter 11 cases, primarily through reports in the media. Elements used in grading: class participation and final exam.",

In the Fall quarter it will meet four hours per week. In the Winter quarter, it will meet ONLY FOR FIVE WEEKS for four hours per week--for 2 units of course credit. During those five weeks, the course will meet on Tuesday and Thursday. Exactly which five weeks the course will meet will be announced during the Winter quarter. This will involve scheduling with outside guests, but I will make every effort to schedule those five weeks for the first half of the quarter.  Students enrolled in the course must take both quarters. All of the first quarter will be spent in a traditional classroom setting but with untraditional materials. Most of the materials consist of case studies of business transactions (and no case law). We will use those case studies to analyze the economics underlying a wide range of business transactions and the contractual terms and structures used to respond to underlying economic challenges. During the second quarter, we will explore deals in greater detail by studying five complex transactions in full. For this part of the course, students will be divided into groups and will be assigned one of the five deals. Each group will give a presentation of its deal to the class, and in the following class, a lawyer or other participant in the deal will come to class to present the deal based on his or her experience. We study five new deals each year. Deals we have studied over the years have included movie financings, biotech alliances, venture capital financings, cross-border joint ventures, private equity investments, corporate reorganizations, and more. Special Instructions: Students who have not taken the course in the Fall cannot register for it in the Winter, and those who took it in the Fall must register for it in the Winter. There is no exam in Winter Term. An In-School exam will be given at the conclusion of the course in the Winter Term.

In addition, students will focus on understanding key legal contracts that underpin the global derivatives industry, in particular focusing on the ISDA&copy; Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex, as well as documentation supporting credit derivatives and other common derivative types. Students will also consider the shifting regulatory landscape for financial institutions and hedge funds as it relates to the way in which these products are traded, with rates and credit products migrating to clearinghouses. The course will conclude with an examination of the economic crisis that erupted with Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in September 2008 and the consequent policy reactions to that event from a derivatives and bankruptcy perspective.

Instead, the practice of entertainment law lies at the intersection of various traditional legal disciplines, such as contract, tort, copyright, trademark, antitrust, secured transactions, etc., and applies those disciplines to a unique business setting. This course is intended to approach the study of entertainment law from a practical perspective, applying the principles of traditional legal disciplines to avoid problems and find solutions in various facets of the entertainment industry. To accomplish the necessary background, we will study the entertainment industry from both a macro level (i.e., the organization of the motion picture, television and music business, including the function of studios, producers, networks, record companies, agencies, managers, lawyers and labor unions) and a micro level (i.e., examining actual agreements in order to understand the principal components of motion picture talent, production and distribution contracts, television series contracts, music and book publishing contracts). We will also examine key litigation issues that affect the industry, such as the interaction of the First Amendment and the right of publicity, the right of privacy and libel, the anti-SLAPP laws, the &quot;final cut&quot; and profit participation cases. The impact of the digital media (including the internet) will, of course, be analyzed, along with the future of the entertainment industry, including convergence, holograms, syntho-thespians and the like. We plan to include guest speakers from the entertainment industry so that this class will embody both business and legal considerations. The overall goals of this course are (1) to expose students to the unique and increasingly complex structure of the entertainment business; (2) to foster an understanding of the role the law and entertainment lawyers play in that unique business structure; (3) to strengthen students' ability to draft key documents and craft persuasive legal arguments to accomplish the goals they may seek to achieve as lawyers in the entertainment industry; and (4) to develop the analytical and problem-solving skills necessary to make them into effective entertainment lawyers.

Topics will include: pricing, structuring and valuation of private equity and venture capital investments; buyouts and other transactions involving multitiered capital structures; the structure and governance of PE and VC funds; conceptual issues relevant in this realm such as option theory, asymmetric information and bounded rationality; and private equity as a distinct asset class. There are no required prerequisites. Students will develop skills and tools used in the private equity arena, including financial analysis (e.g., &quot;deal arithmetic&quot; fundamentals, spreadsheet modeling and forecast preparation); the drafting and negotiation of transaction documents; and the ability to conduct comprehensive due diligence examinations of prospective acquisitions and investments. We will have a number of guest speakers during the term, and will draw on various materials illustrative of what one would encounter in private equity deals and funds. Elements Used in Grading: Periodic problem sets, a final case study and class participation. (The case study will be completed in a small group, and it will give students the opportunity to analyze a real-world transaction from a number of perspectives.) A Final Note: While a 3-credit course, Private Equity Investing will not meet for the entirety of the Winter quarter. The final class session will be on March 2nd (rather than March 12th). This class is limited to 24 students. 16 SLS students will be selected by lottery. The other eight spots will be allocated by consent of instructor, and will be selected from law students who were waitlisted and non-law students. All interested students must attend the first two class sessions (January 10 &amp; 12) in order to keep a spot on the class list or waitlist.",

Since it is especially relevant now, coverage of restrictive land use controls will be covered, as well as a discussion of some approaches to increasing access to property ownership among lower income groups. Classes will be a mixture of lectures, interactive discussions, and several mock negotiations.

It will prepare you for the 3-credit version (Corporate Finance 1009) and introduce you to principles of valuation that are useful in everything from family law to settlement negotiations over civil disputes. The course provides a framework for answering the basic question: how much is this firm (or project) worth? We will cover topics such as: earnings, cash flows, income statements, interest rates, time value of money, risk and return and the cost of capital. No prior knowledge of finance or fancy math skills will be assumed. The course will consist primarily of on-line modules and problem sets that you will complete on your own and in small groups.  We will have &quot;live&quot; class sessions to discuss the application of these principles in a legal setting and to hear from lawyers, investors and policy makers how finance has been useful in their careers. There will be weekly problem sets and you will get experience with building a simple excel spreadsheet that will help you estimate the value of a potential new project. There is a final project where you are asked to value a company and present your teams' findings to the class. On-line component. Elements used in grading: Written Assignments, Final Project.

        "description": "Success as an attorney and businessperson depends on the ability to predict outcomes in complex situations. Law school courses generally do not develop this skill set. The traditional &quot;case method&quot; asks us to understand how and why cases have been decided. I contrast, this course's &quot;prediction method&quot; challenges students to understand how and why cases yet to be decided will be resolved. The course addresses the academic literature related to prediction, and uses a series of case studies related to undecided cases currently on the US Supreme Court docket to develop student skills as predictors and analysts of complex litigation and transactional situations. This course is open only to students who have already taken and successfully completed a course on Corporate Law or Securities Regulation.

Rather than meeting with the lawyers involved in those deals here at Stanford, as we do in Deals II, we will meet in Hong Kong.  Students will complete their papers on these deals shortly following their week in Hong Kong.  Second, we have a variety of meetings in Hong Kong in which we learn about transactions that are handled by lawyers and bankers there and more generally about business in that part of the world.",

        "description": "Large corporations now routinely spend millions of dollars to protect human rights and the environment. Shell Nigeria builds hospitals and schools in the Niger Delta. Nike employs hundreds of inspectors to improve conditions for the factory workers who produce its shoes across Asia and Latin America. Technology companies such as Facebook have scrambled to fend off the threat of new regulation since the Cambridge Analytica revelations. Other examples abound, across industries and around the globe. &quot;Don't be evil&quot; (Google's former motto) may be one motivation for these companies, but something more mundane is also at work: many companies believe they will do well, financially, if they do good, ethically. This course examines questions that lawyers in large law firms, corporations, NGOs, and government agencies regularly confront: --How does business activity affect human rights and other &quot;social&quot; goods (such as the environment and community cohesion)?  --What factors, internal and external to companies, shape corporate decisions that have human rights/social impacts? When does it serve a company's interest to take costly action to address human rights, labor, and environmental concerns? -- What tactics have activists used to shift public opinion, media frames, and the law, and thereby change companies' incentives? We will learn through seminar-style discussion, lectures, role play, and small group exercises. Several guest speakers with experience in business, advocacy, or in between will provide insights from their experiences on the ground. Special Instructions: Students have the option to write a long research paper in lieu of the final exam with consent of instructor.

The class operates along two concurrent paths:  First, under faculty supervision, students will act as if they were outside counsel to a Stanford-affiliated startup, learning the business and personal goals of the founder(s) and spotting  the relevant legal and non-legal issues.  Students will use formal analytical frameworks, including legal research, business strategy, policy strategy, and design thinking, to craft a comprehensive review of the startup's position within the applicable regulatory and business environment, and will present their strategy recommendations to the founder(s) and a panel of faculty and outside experts.  Second, students will engage in a case-based exploration of complex legal, regulatory, and ethical issues that often occur in early stage companies.  Through focused case studies, students will be required to spot issues, analyze potential outcomes, and make defensible recommendations for legal and business strategy. Issues covered will include corporate formation and capitalization, entering regulated marketplaces, supply chain ethics, employment and culture, and multi-jurisdictional scaling.

Students will then engage readings regarding the regulatory difficulties presented by the realities of cryptocurrency technology.

In particular, we will look at the role of the board in financing activities, M&amp;A activities and various special situations. The course will utilize case law as well as various articles and case studies to articulate the potential governance issues boards may encounter.  We will focus on practical applications of the rules to real-world situations, with the goal of preparing students  post-graduation  to  be  able to  properly  advise venture-backed  boards  on  how  to  successfully navigate many of the governance  challenge.

We will discuss design topics such as how contracts respond to incomplete information, the &quot;make or buy&quot; choice (whether to carry out a project within a firm or contract with an external party), the role of judicial enforcement in relational contracts, the use of vague and/or precise language in agreements, obstacles and process of innovation in contracting, and the role and effect of bargaining power.

The two main areas examined are competition policy and economic regulation. Competition policy refers to laws that define certain market behavior as illegal because it is harmful to competition or fails to provide consumer benefits that justify its costs to consumers. Economic regulation refers to policies in which government controls prices and/or decides the terms and conditions under which firms can participate in a market. A growing area of study and policy design is the introduction of market mechanisms into formerly regulated industries such as: telecommunications, electricity, airlines, railroads, postal delivery services and environmental regulation.

        "description": "This course will focus on the so-called &quot;FinTech Revolution&quot; which is transforming traditional banking and financial services.  FinTech generally refers to disruptive financial sector innovations involving technology-enabled (online and mobile device-based) business models.  Independent FinTech businesses can facilitate disintermediation, create and deliver novel products and services, increase access and inclusivity, reduce costs and both create and address privacy, regulatory and law-enforcement challenges.  FinTech can also refer to the increasingly technological approaches that both incumbents and entrepreneurial ventures take to the main financial intermediation functions, e.g., maturity transformation, payments, capital raising and remittances, and to &quot;back end&quot; data systems and regulatory compliance.  The goal of the course will be for students to understand the major categories of FinTech innovation in the U.S., including crypto currency and blockchain, the evolving business models and regulatory and legal structures that underlie these categories, and the opportunities and risks that emerging FinTech business models create for financial, legal and regulatory systems.  Non-U.S. examples will be used to compare and contrast different approaches to key policy issues.  Four key themes will be emphasized:  1) Understanding innovative business models in emerging FinTech.  2) FinTech competition and cooperation with the existing financial services ecosystem and 'big tech.'  3) Financial regulatory and legal system coverage of, mismatches with, and adaptation to, emerging FinTech business models.  4) Public Policy issues surrounding FinTech (Innovation and efficiency; Personal financial data ownership, use, control and liability; Financial stability; Financial inclusion and consumer financial health).

        "title": "Corporate Purpose: Beyond Shareholder Value",
        "description": "The neoliberal orthodoxy that corporate managers' sole duty is to maximize shareholders' financial value has never been entirely adhered to in practice and has been increasingly challenged in recent decades. While acknowledging the importance of shareholder value, commentators have argued that corporations should purposively benefit other stakeholders, including customers, employees, and the communities they affect. At the same time, there has been an upswing of investments aligned with investors' social interests, including public equity investments in companies with high environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings and private equity &quot;impact investments&quot; that typically incur greater risks than pure market rate investments. This course will consider a variety of legal, ethical, and policy issues related to corporations' purposes and responsibilities, including: the meanings and measures of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and ESG criteria; disclosure of a company's environmental and social harms or risks; when is it legally and ethically appropriate for corporate managers or institutional investors to compromise shareholder value in the pursuit of social, environmental and other nonpecuniary goals; constituency statutes and benefit corporations that reflect interests other than profit maximization; the power of investors to influence corporate behavior through affirmative investments, divestments and shareholder activism; the power of various stakeholder groups to influence corporate behavior; proposals for broadening the purpose of corporations; barriers to these various practices and proposals; and whether they can be accommodated within neoliberal ideology or require a new framework. You may write a series of short commentaries on four of the sessions. Students electing this option will be graded on a Mandatory Pass/Restricted Credit/Fail basis and receive 2 units of credit. Alternatively, you may write a single empirical research paper on a topic of your choice. This will satisfy the Law School's Research requirement. These papers will be graded on an Honors/Pass/Restricted Credit/Fail basis. Students taking the seminar for R credit can take the seminar for either 2 or 3 units of credit (section 02), depending on the project and paper length. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  This class is limited to 20 students, with an effort made to have students from SLS (15 students by lottery) and 5 GSB students by instructor consent.

These taxation methods are a principal source for local government finance in many countries and have substantial economic impact. We will examine real property taxation methodologies across the world, creating an appreciation for the scope and typology of legal arrangements. We then will examine economic, business, and policy implications. Topics include, among others, the impact of the tax on land use and property values, tax incidence, choice of rates, inter-jurisdictional tax competition, the impact on state and local finance, collection and enforcement, the politics surrounding the tax, and technical issues such as property valuation and computer assisted mass appraisal. We will devote a significant amount of time in the course to land taxation, taxes that apply only to land values and not to the value of structures. This method has huge promise and has been implemented in some locales across the world but is much less widely applied than the conventional property tax that applies to total value, structures as well as land. The course should be of interest to students contemplating careers involving real estate legal practice, real estate business, or public policy.  Elements used in grading:  Exam.",

This course, designed as an extension of LAW1043, will explore the technical capabilities of blockchains and cryptocurrencies by offering students practical, hands-on experience. We will build a technical foundation through a crash course on programming and cryptography while discussing the current legal landscape and implications of both. Then, we will build a decentralized application on the Ethereum blockchain and learn why this opens so many tricky legal doors in the form of (things like) mixers, NFTs, and censorship-resistant code. Students will have the chance to get familiar with and use actual blockchain-based tools, ranging from decentralized finance protocols to DAOs to on-chain development toolkits. At the end of this course, students will understand not just how to safely interact with blockchains, but how they enable legal gray areas--and their potential to disrupt the legal landscape in the future.

We begin by examining the goals of corporate law and explanations for governance diversity around the globe. We consider the role of the state as an investor in business enterprises, the governance of corporate groups found throughout the world, and take up the significant global debate about the &quot;purpose&quot; of the corporation and the focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues by corporate stakeholders. The seminar next turns to specific areas of corporate governance and finance in which there is considerable diversity among jurisdictions, including shareholder activism; the regulation of takeovers; and startup ecosystems. The grade for the seminar will be based on a final paper and the quality of class participation, including performance on several short exercises.

We will cover these topics both from a technical perspective and from a social scientific perspective, and will include a range of guests from the web3 space.  This course is a mixture of legal, technical, and governance (business-oriented) material, with a roughly equal number of classes devoted to each of the three aspects. Instructors will include several speakers who are on the frontiers of legal development of DAOs. The course does not presume a blockchain or technical background.  DAOs and blockchain governance are exciting areas of rapid development. It is likely that DAO-type structures will replace or supplement current legal arrangements currently embodied in business corporations, non-profit organizations, and government institutions. This course offers a chance to get in on the ground floor. Among other topics, we will discuss in detail, with considerable emphasis on legal issues, the best ways to start a DAO.  Elements used in grading:  Homework and papers.  There are no examinations.  Cross-listed with the Graduate School of Business (GSBGEN 323) and Computer Science 352B.

Students curious about a non-litigation practice, students unfamiliar with the business world, students intending to do corporate -- all are welcome. The course will have a practical orientation. It will help you prepare for summer jobs and for OCI in the fall, help you make more informed choices about course selection, and give you practical exposure to contracts and other legal documents. And we'll come at professional identity from a different perspective than that of the litigation-oriented first year.  Along the way we'll look at major practice areas (e.g., corporate governance, capital markets, M&amp;A, licensing and other commercial relationships); work with representative materials such as contracts, governance documents, and public company financial disclosures; talk about lawyer activities, relevant skills, client service, and corporate pro bono; and suggest some ways to get your hands around and do everyday lawyer work.  The course is neither a prerequisite nor a substitute for core business law classes such as Corporations, Securities Regulation, and Commercial Law. It's also not a substitute for business-oriented classes such as Accounting, Introduction to Finance, and Corporate Finance; for skills courses such as Advanced Legal Writing: Business Transactions and Advanced Legal Research: Transactional; or for programming provided by the Office of Career Services. But it should provide good context for those courses and programs.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, class participation , and written assignments.",

We then consider how these laws and institutions should respond to pressing issues:  (1) financial crises and the Covid-19 shock; (2) economic inequality and discrimination; (3) the ESG movement; (4) the proliferation of crypto assets; (5) terrorist financing an d money-laundering; and (6) international conflict and statecraft (as in the war in Ukraine or tension between US and China).

        "description": "This course offers an opportunity to study the history, legal structure, and financial incentives of the startup economy while getting hands-on experience advising clients--Stanford founders building sustainability startups. The curriculum has three pillars: lectures and guest lectures outlining fundamental concepts and topics, a simulation in which all students will represent &quot;Model Corporation&quot; throughout its early life cycle, and advisory work on actual startup client matters. For the client work, students will perform client intake, draft an initial scope of work, complete due diligence and make supplemental due diligence requests, make any necessary adjustments to scope of work, and ultimately deliver work product in the format most appropriate &amp; valuable for the particular matter (e.g., drafted documents, written memos, and oral presentations). Because of the nature of the client relationship the course relies on students' hard work, flexibility, and commitment to keeping pace with the material and assignments. The class will meet for 4 hours per week  Elements used in grading: Class Participation, Attendance, Written Assignments, Final Take-Home Exam.

        "description": "Since the early 1970s, the criminal justice system in the United States has expanded dramatically.  America has adopted an array of increasingly tough approaches to crime, including aggressive street-level policing, longer sentences, and a range of collateral consequences for criminal convictions.  As a result, there are currently 2.2 million persons in prisons and jails and seven million under some form of correctional supervision.  The impact on communities of color has been especially profound: In many of our nation's cities, nearly one-half of young black men are in the criminal justice system.  This seminar will begin with readings discussing the tough-on-crime era's historical roots. We will then turn to examine the impact of these policies. Finally, we will turn to current efforts to resist and reform the system that has been created. This portion of the seminar will focus on violent crime, and whether and how to respond to violent crime differently than we currently do.  The assigned reading will be substantial, and will come from a wide variety of sources, including history, sociology, political science, criminology, and law.

        "description": "This seminar offers an opportunity to study mass incarceration and criminal law reform in real time while getting hands-on experience in active litigation on behalf of Three Strikes Project clients serving life sentences for nonviolent crimes. In this course, students read and analyze a variety of cases and articles, examining the evolution of incarceration and sentencing policies in California and across the country. Students also assist with live post-conviction litigation on behalf of clients in trial and appellate courts across the country. The class focuses largely on the Three Strikes law as a case study in the history, politics, constitutional doctrine, and reform of criminal law policy. The Project has been intimately involved in the criminal law reform movement, partnering with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and Obama administration on different projects. Students enrolled in the seminar quickly become involved in all aspects of the Project's work, including assistance with different stages of ongoing litigation. Students will visit a Project client in prison, conduct factual investigations, and draft pleadings on our clients' behalf. The Project is an active, fast-paced organization that depends on the hard work and contributions of law students enrolled in this seminar. This seminar offers the opportunity to both study the theory behind the law and to hone practical litigation and advocacy skills. The seminar will meet for 3 hours per week, including 1 hour small group meetings with Project director Michael Romano.

        "description": "(Formerly Law 621) This introductory course will familiarize students with the history, structure, and performance of America's sentencing and corrections system for adult offenders. Sentencing is the process by which criminal sanctions are imposed in individual cases following criminal convictions. Corrections deals with the implementation and evaluation of criminal sentences after they are handed down. In fact, the two subject areas are inseparable. The course will examine sentencing and corrections from global and historical views, from theoretical and policy perspectives, and with close attention to many problem-specific areas. We will explore: (1) sentencing theories and their application; (2) the nature, scope and function of jails, prisons, probation and parole; (3) the impact of incarceration on crime, communities, and racial justice; (4) the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs; (5) the collateral consequences of a criminal conviction; (6) special prison populations (e.g., mentally ill) and policies (e.g., solitary confinement); (7) prison litigation and conditions of confinement; and (8) parole, risk prediction, and prisoner reentry. These topics will be considered as they play out in current political and policy debates. Guest lectures may include presentations by legal professionals, victims, offenders, and correctional leaders. This course is open to 1Ls, 2Ls, and 3Ls in the Law School. Special Instructions: Grades will be based on class participation (which will include a class presentation), and three reflection papers of 5 to 7 pages each. Due dates will be listed in the class syllabus. Elements used in grading: Final grades will be based on the three reflection papers (25% each) and class participation (25%).",

        "title": "United States v. Milken: A Case Study",
        "description": "The most recent financial crisis that began in 2008 has resulted in a call, mostly ignored, for significant jail time for those allegedly responsible, without any explanation of the crimes that may have been committed. The aggressive use of the criminal laws to respond to perceived financial abuse probably had its birth in the prosecution of Michael Milken. Although folks will differ about the prosecution, there is no realistic dispute about the influence Mr MILKEN has had in creating the markets which made possible for new ideas and ventures to have access to the capital needed to build and thrive. . MILKEN effectively developed the so called &quot;junk bonds&quot; market which was the engine that allowed for this theoretically high risk capital to be effectively deployed. As the high yield market grew, Michael Milken and the firm he worked for, Drexel Burnham became the largest and most effective competitor in the market place. This led to a call for an investigation and coincided with a significant insider trading investigation centered on Ivan Boesky (fictionalized in the first Wall Street movie). The US Attorney in NY at the time was Rudolph Giulliani (later Mayor of NY and, more recently, know for his representation of President Trump in various matters including the Ukrainian matter) who led the investigation. Ultimately Mr MILKEN was indicted and pled guilty and was imprisoned. This seminar will involve an in depth study of the circumstances surrounding the high yield securities market and the investigation, indictment and guilty pleas and the subsequent impact of the case. The seminar will examine the tools available to prosecutors, including the use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) in white collar cases, in pursuing this and other cases, the affect of the media in high profile cases and other systemic elements that come into play. The seminar will feature presentations of many colorful key players including those involved in the prosecution and defense and those with knowledge of the high yield markets. The seminar will be taught jointly by Professor Mills (who was intimately involved with Mr MILKEN and defended some of the other cases which arose at the time) and Richard Sandler who served as Michael Milken's personal counsel throughout the time and has continued to work with Michael Milken to the present time.

        "description": "Over the course of the past two decades there has been increasing recognition that, despite its commitment to the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, our criminal justice system yields a steady stream of wrongful convictions. This Seminar will focus on some causes, preventions and potential remedies for this phenomenon. Subjects to be addressed include eyewitness identification, interrogations and confessions, jailhouse informant testimony, forensic evidence, the psychology of tunnel vision and confirmation bias, the role of appellate review and habeas corpus, the role of clemency, the impact of the problem on the death penalty, and issues around compensation of those who have been wrongly convicted. As we study these subjects, we will also reflect on whether taking some reforms too far will impair on the efficacy of legitimate law enforcement. The class will meet for two hours each week. In addition, there will be three additional evening or weekend sessions (to be scheduled at the convenience of the participants). During each of these additional sessions, students will watch a film involving a wrongful conviction and will engage in conversation about the particular case involved. Each student will be responsible for preparing a paper on an appropriate topic to be chosen in consultation with the instructor.

        "description": "This course examines the theoretical foundations of criminal procedure---political, historical, and, above all, philosophical. What are the ideas at work in the American system of criminal procedure? How, historically, did the system develop, and why does it presently function as it does? Is the system broken and, if so, what principles should orient us in fixing it? This theoretical inquiry has a practical point. Procedure plays a major role in the present crisis of American criminal justice. By examining criminal procedure's theoretical foundations, this course aims to develop competing &quot;big picture,&quot; synthetic perspectives on the criminal justice crisis as a whole. Thus, for students interested in criminal justice reform, this course will equip you to take a philosophically richer view of the underlying policy issues. For students thinking about a career in criminal law, this course will equip you to engage in large-scale thinking about how criminal procedure should change, rather than just working within the doctrinal and institutional structures that exist at present. For students interested in legal academia, this course will develop your ability to read sophisticated theoretical material, to write in the same vein, and to relate theoretical ideas to policy prescriptions.  Elements used in grading:  Class participation and, based on individual student preference, either a final reflection paper or a final research paper. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2 or 3 units, depending on paper length.  Cross-listed with Philosophy (PHIL 375K).",

        "title": "History of Criminal Justice",
        "description": "This seminar will deal with the history of criminal justice in the United States, since the colonial period.  The emphasis will not be on doctrines of criminal law, or (for the most part) on reported case law; but rather on the relationship between the working criminal justice system and American society.  Indeed, throughout our history, there has been a huge gulf between the formal law and the way the system actually operated.  At all points, the criminal justice system has responded to social, economic, political and cultural factors; and it is these that the course will focus on.  The students will read a number of original sources that bear on the relationship between law and society, including sources on the rise of the penitentiary, the death penalty, the development of correctional methods, such as parole and indeterminate sentences; also race and gender relations and their influence on criminal justice.  The course will also look at the rise and fall of laws controlling moral and sexual behavior.  Students will be expected to write brief reflection papers (roughly two pages) before each of the sessions in which readings will be discussed.  The reflection papers should not be mere summaries of the readings, rather, students will explain how the readings bore on the general theme or themes of the course; and the student's reaction to the writer's point of view.  Each student will also be asked to develop a topic, carry out research, and write a paper on one or more aspects of the history of criminal justice.  Papers can either be synthetic (a review of the literature on some aspect of the history of criminal justice) or embody original research, using such material as court files, older treatises, and newspaper and periodical literature.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer, with consent of the instructor, from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement. Automatic grading penalty waived for writers.  Elements used in grading:  The grade in the seminar will be based on the paper, and (to a degree) also on class participation, including the reflection papers and an extended take-home exam or an independent research paper.",

        "title": "Regulating Firearms",
        "description": "This seminar will grapple with the issue of firearm regulation in the face of the aggrandized Second Amendment articulated by the Supreme Court in Heller in 2008 and Bruen in 2022.  An important function of law is to establish the rules through which the government regulates and constrains the actions of individuals. Given the high level of firearm violence in the United States compared to other affluent nations, most Americans tell pollsters they would like to see greater levels of controls over firearms.  Many other Americans -- including a majority of the Supreme Court and many state legislatures -- place a higher value on eliminating constraints on the ability to purchase and use firearms.  As with all forms of regulation, the decision to regulate firearms involves complex questions concerning 1) the cost and benefits of government action; 2) the empirical resolution of these issues; 3) the determination about what institution is best equipped to reach or evaluate these empirical judgments; and 4) the competing visions about the rights of the individual versus the public welfare.  We will explore all of these issues in light of the currently evolving complexity of constitutional constraints imposed by the right to keep and bear arms, which will involve a focus on the complex interactions of law, regulation, social science, history, and constitutional law on an issue of considerable present political and substantive salience.

Judges sentence defendants based on statistical risk scores; regulators take enforcement actions based on predicted violations; advertisers target materials based on demographic attributes; and employers evaluate applicants and employees based on machine-learned models. One concern with the rise of such algorithmic decision making is that it may replicate or exacerbate human bias. This course surveys the legal and ethical principles for assessing the equity of algorithms, describes statistical techniques for designing fair systems, and considers how anti-discrimination law and the design of algorithms may need to evolve to account for machine bias.

        "description": "This will be a 2-hour advanced criminal procedure class, designed to acquaint students with the challenges confronting judges as they apply the Fourth Amendment to the bewildering array of  search and surveillance techniques available to law enforcement in the 21st century. Various surveillance techniques will be examined, such as cell site simulators, GPS and RFID tracking devices, remote computer access (NITs), biometric identification, facial recognition technology, and automated license plate readers.  The novel legal and practical issues generated by computer-based search techniques will be explored, for example: Should the plain view exception apply to computer searches? Are ex ante  conditions on computer search warrants necessary, or even advisable? When is compulsion of biometric device identifiers appropriate? Can providers be compelled to decrypt locked cell phones? What are the notice requirements for search warrants directed to service providers? What limits should be placed on border searches of electronic devices? After the Supreme Court's 2018 decision in Carpenter, what rules govern law enforcement access to medical or genetic databases maintained by third parties? How is a cell tower dump order distinguishable from a general warrant? What are the particularity requirements for search warrants seeking electronically stored information? Should there be super-warrant requirements pertaining to minimization and overcollection for such searches? What about extraterritoriality and conflict of law issues raised by U.S. law enforcement access to data stored on foreign servers?  Broader policy questions will also be addressed. For example, is it sensible to rely on the exclusionary rule to develop Fourth Amendment doctrine in this &quot;golden age of surveillance&quot;? Are courts or legislatures better equipped to regulate modern police investigations? What lessons can be learned from comparative approaches to police regulation in other countries?  The course will build upon foundations laid in the Criminal Procedure--Investigation and Criminal Procedure--Adjudication courses. Those classes touch upon the basics of search warrants and the Fourth Amendment, and both are recommended prerequisites for this class.  The next generation of judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and civil rights advocates will be forced to apply existing legal precedent to unprecedented surveillance technologies generated by the digital era. This course is designed to help them meet that daunting challenge.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Class Participation, Final Exam.",

        "description": "In this course students will participate in direct dialogs with major national experts and institutional leaders from a variety of perspectives on the country's criminal law system. We will hear from experts and leaders from law enforcement, prosecution, public defense, the judiciary, and corrections, and policy experts (including from the academic world). The thematic coverage of the course will be broad, covering empirical assessments of the state of criminal justice in the US, efforts to bring the country out of the phase of mass incarceration while maintaining record-low crime rates, reforms in our sentencing laws (including the death penalty), assessing what is meant by the rubric &quot;progressive prospection,&quot; the workload challenges of public defenders, addressing the problem of wrongful convictions, and racial discrimination in both investigation and adjudication of crime.  Each week there will be a Zoom interview with a guest. The instructors will interview the guests, and students will then participate in a Q and A phase. The interview sessions will generally run 90 minutes. For each guest there will be preassigned material  to be read before the interview. Within 2 days after each interview, students will turn in 3-page reflection papers derived from the interview and reading.  The final product will be a 10-page essay on a topic that has emerged from the course. This 10 page paper need not me a scholarly or research endeavor. It can be, in effect, a more extended reflection essay.  We anticipate that for most weeks we will have one guest, either Monday or Wednesday, and the other day will be reserved for more elaborate discussions of the most previous guest's presentation or of  reading for the next guest. There may be one or 2 weeks where we have 2 guests. While we are just now settling the guest list and anticipate some very exciting additions,  for sure it will include Barry Scheck, founder of the famed Innocence Project.  Professor Rachel Barkow of NYU. Leading authority on criminal justice administration. Earlonne Woods, former California life prisoner and co-creator and now co-producer and writer for of the Ear Hustle podcast.

        "description": "Prosecutors wield enormous power over life, liberty and reputation and are subject to ethical standards higher than those that apply to other attorneys. As former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sutherland recognized in the context of federal prosecutors, &quot;[t]he United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all, and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.&quot; A U.S. Attorney may &quot;strike hard blows&quot; but not &quot;foul ones.&quot; This course examines the distinct roles and responsibilities of U.S. Attorneys in the enforcement of federal criminal laws. We will review the ways in which a federal prosecutor exercises discretion in deciding whether or not to charge, what crimes to charge, and what punishments to seek. We will examine charging both individuals and corporate entities in the context of the priorities and policies of different administrations as well as the prosecutor's individual ethical obligations. This will be done on both a practical and conceptual level. Introductory sessions will focus on the historical evolution of the office, beginning with the Judiciary Act of 1789, and examine the office's complex (and unique) role within the system of separation of powers (including the appointment of Independent Counsel, Special Counsel and the judicial appointment of United States Attorneys). It will also explore related theoretical questions involving the prosecutorial role as well as challenges to the constitutionality of the judicial role in selecting US Attorneys. The bulk of the course will involve class sessions centered on different federal cases that involved difficult questions of prosecutorial decision-making. We will discuss the tools prosecutors use in exercising their discretion, including non-prosecution agreements, deferred prosecution agreements and cooperation agreements. The course will also explore the relationship between the U.S. Attorney and &quot;Main Justice&quot; and the extent to which the U.S. Attorney has independent decision-making authority. It will delve into the conflicts that may arise, and it will examine the appropriate framework for resolution of those conflicts.  All students will write a paper for the class.  Students may optionally elect to write an independent research paper for R credit.  Students should submit at least 15 pages in the non-R (01) section.  Students receiving R credit must abide by the Law School's research paper requirements -- which have the effect, because this is a three-credit course, of imposing a 26-page minimum.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can email registrar@law.stanford.edu to transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement.  Please observe the Registrar's deadline (final study list deadline) for switching into the R section.  Elements used in grading: Attendance, class participation, research paper.",

        "description": "This seminar is essentially an advanced criminal law class in which we will be studying selected criminal law/procedure issues. The only prerequisite is having taken Criminal Law. Each week you will be asked to watch a particular episode of the long running television series: Law and Order or one of the spin-offs. As you may know there are nearly 1000 episodes and we will be watching and discussing only nine. There are many strong and differing opinions about favorite episodes, so it is likely we will not be studying one of your personal favorites.  We will however, discuss such recurring issues like police cutting corners in connection with 4th and 5th Amendment rights, the role of plea bargaining, the role of different actors in the system and so much more. The class will meet twice a week for (60/75?) minutes. During the first class, we will watch selected portions of the television show (you will have already watched the episode prior to the class) and then we will then discuss, at a very high level, the criminal law issues which the show raises. During the second class, a few assigned students will undertake an in-depth analysis of those issues and will lead the discussion. All students will be expected to write a paper on a criminal law topic raised during the class in lieu of a final exam.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Class Participation, Final Paper.",

        "description": "This course addresses the role of the federal courts in the American system of federalism and separation of powers, as well as their role in the development of substantive federal law and constitutional rights. A central premise of the course is that the institutional, political, and constitutional features of federal litigation cannot be understood without engaging the historical and theoretical context, especially the social, political, and legal movements in response to which the federal courts have developed and related assumptions about structural constitutional theory (including federalism, supremacy, separation of powers, and judicial review). Thus while many of the traditional aspects of federal court jurisprudence will be covered (e.g., federal common law including implied rights of action, justiciability doctrines and other doctrines of restraint, congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create &quot;legislative courts&quot; outside of Article III, Supreme Court review of judgments, state sovereign immunity, litigating against the government, and federal habeas corpus), the doctrine will be assessed from an interdisciplinary perspective, including social, political, and theoretical accounts that reveal how the courts and ordinary Americans have come to understand the distinctive role of the federal courts, as well as claims for expansion or contraction of their powers.  The course is recommended for students interested in pursuing a career in litigation, government service, and/or judicial clerkships.  Special Instructions: In Winter 2023 the Federal Courts class will be capped at 45 students and conducted in small group sessions of 5 students per group.  Required class participation includes (a) weekly pre-recorded lectures introducing assigned materials, and (b) weekly small group sessions. The small group sessions are led by Professor Spaulding every week.  Some groups will have their sessions during the regularly scheduled hours of the course, but most groups will meet in sessions scheduled during other mutually convenient time slots each week.  (Scheduling software will be used to generate time slots for each group for the quarter and students' availability will be solicited).  The readings and pre-recorded lectures must be completed before attending small group sessions.  The small group sessions run approximately 70 minutes each week and will be led by Professor Spaulding in person assuming health regulations permit.  If this is not possible, they will be conducted online.  The goal of this format is to create an engaging, interactive, and intellectually rigorous setting for exploration of the course materials and themes.  Note that class time is not used for basic exposition of cases -- students are expected to have used the readings and lectures to internalize the basic doctrine.  We will instead use our sessions to focus on the hardest doctrinal and structural constitutional questions presented by the cases.  Each group will cover a common set of 'hard questions,' so careful preparation is obligatory.  There is usually some time for brief Q&amp;A each week, but the sessions are not conducted as open-ended tutorials.  Although none is a prerequisite, students generally report that it is useful to have taken some or all of the following classes: Advanced Civ Pro, Administrative Law, Con Law II, Criminal Procedure, Remedies.  Elements used in grading: Grading will be based on attendance, participation, a short paper, and a take home final exam. Interested students should fill out a consent form indicating understanding of and interest in this format.  Course Planning Note: The law school offers a standard format, open enrollment course in another quarter, so if you are not interested in the small group format or can't take the risk of consent admission in the winter quarter, please plan your academic year and course selection accordingly.

        "description": "German owned VW admits that it included a &quot;defeat device&quot; in the software for its diesel cars so they could fraudulently pass US environmental tests, and is sued by thousands of US consumers in state and federal courts in the US. Very quickly, the cases are consolidated in the federal court in Northern California. Meanwhile, special purpose foundations are established in the Netherlands to seek a settlement with VW on behalf of European consumers under the Dutch collective settlement act, and a securities lawsuit on behalf of investors whose share values have dropped dramatically is filed in Germany, using that country's special group litigation procedure. The Dutch foundations may be coordinating their actions with US lawyers, the shareholders in Germany are represented by the local partners of a leading US-based litigation boutique, and the shareholder suit is funded by a UK-based international litigation financing firm. In 2019, a jury in E.D. Va. delivers a verdict holding a former Somali army commander now living in the U.S. liable under the Torture Victim Protection Act for compensatory and punitive damages to a Somali citizen he injured 30 years ago. The plaintiff is represented by the Center for Justice &amp; Accountability in San Francisco and DLA Piper lawyers serving pro bono; the witnesses include public and private actors from different countries. In 2011, US-based Apple sues Korea-based Samsung for patent infringement in N.D. CA and Samsung counter-sues in Korea, Japan and Germany. A year later more than 50 lawsuits are ongoing in more than 10 countries. Two years later the companies agree to drop their litigation outside the US and focus their resources on their US litigation battle. Apple wins a big judgment in the federal court in San Jose but Samsung appeals all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court. SCOTUS rejects the appeal and remands and in Spring 2018 the case is on the calendar for the third time in San Jose. Philip Morris' Hong Kong subsidiary files a claim in an international arbitration tribunal charging that Australia's public health protection statute regarding tobacco marketing violates Australia's bi-lateral investment treaty with Hong Kong. The arbitration claim is filed after the parent company unsuccessfully challenged Australia's statute before the High Court. In December 2015 the arbitration tribunal rules that it does not have jurisdiction over Philip Morris' claim effectively dismissing it. But controversy over Philip Morris' and other multi-national corporations' attempts to use investment arbitration to challenge diverse health, safety and environmental protection regulations derails international trade negotiations and leads to efforts to establish an international court for investment disputes. These high-profile cases illustrate an important aspect of complex litigation: across many different substantive domains, in court and ADR proceedings, disputes that used to be contained within national borders are now trans-national. This seminar will consider the doctrinal, procedural and practical challenges that arise when litigation goes global. We will consider the high profile cases in which these issues have played out in recent years and hear from some of the lawyers (in-person or via zoom) who are creating a new virtual international court system for the resolution of global disputes. The goal of the seminar is to develop an understanding of how the global dimension of high-stakes complex disputes shapes parties' and lawyers' strategies and judges' decisions. The seminar will meet 3 times a week. A small number of seminar sessions will be conducted via zoom in collaboration with law faculty and students in Canada, the Netherlands and Germany, three countries that have adopted procedures for dealing with large-scale civil litigation in distinctive fashions.  Special Instructions: Students on the waitlist for the course will be admitted if spots are available on the basis of priority and degree program.

        "title": "Arbitration: Law, Practice & Politics",
        "description": "Arbitration, once narrowly defined as a party-selected method for resolving contract-based disputes arising out of commercial transactions, is now ubiquitous. In the U.S. in addition to resolving run-of the-mill commercial disputes, arbitration may be used to resolve claims invoking anti-trust, securities, and civil rights law, and consumers, employees, patients and other individual claimants may be held to arbitration provisions included in form contracts drafted by corporations that the individuals overlooked or barely understood. Businesses too may find themselves held to an arbitration clause hastily chosen by a transactional lawyer who didn't understand what she was committing her client to. Economic globalization has created increased demand for international commercial arbitration, which offers binding resolution of trans-national business disputes, enforceable in virtually every court in the world. The increased frequency of complex high-value international transactions involving key industries -- e.g. energy and telecommunications -- has led to an increasing fraction of transnational business disputes with a significant public policy dimension. Moreover, the desires of countries with less developed economies to attract foreign direct investment has led to the creation of a specialized form of arbitration for disputes between private investors and states.  Often bundled with other forms of alternative dispute resolution (&quot;ADR&quot;) such as mediation, arbitration is actually a rule-defined adjudicative procedure, in which parties submit their disputes to privately-chosen and privately-paid decision-makers who deliver binding (and usually unappealable) outcomes, often in closed proceedings. The law that governs arbitration is a mix of domestic statutes (e.g., in the U.S., the Federal Arbitration Act) and international conventions (e.g., the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (&quot;ICSID&quot;)) that have been entered into by a large majority of countries.  Today, arbitration offers a challenging and lucrative practice area to lawyers representing corporations in multiple industries, in domestic and international contexts, and to lawyers serving as arbitrators, who often command high hourly rates. Understanding the differences and similarities among arbitration law and practice in multiple domains and the intersection of public and private law is valuable to lawyers who specialize in arbitration. This seminar is intended for students who wish to develop this capacity as well as for students who want to understand better how to draft business contracts that will protect their clients should they find themselves subject to arbitration.  Although arbitration is well-accepted around the world, certain applications of arbitration have become increasingly controversial. In the U.S. the requirement that employees agree to arbitrate sexual harassment claims as a condition of employment has led to boycotts against &quot;big law&quot; firms. Requirements to arbitrate disputes between private investors and national governments have knocked high-profile multi-lateral trade negotiations off-track. Some business decision-makers are turning away from arbitration for &quot;ordinary&quot; commercial disputes, arguing that it has become as expensive and time-consuming as court adjudication, without the protections of the latter.  In this course we will consider separately and together, the statutes that provide the legal framework for arbitration, the specific rules that govern different types of arbitration, the ongoing controversies evoked by some of these rules and their application, and the reforms that have been proposed in response to these controversies. We will read and discuss U.S. case law, international arbitration decisions, academic commentary and empirical analyses of arbitration use and consequences, and hear from leading arbitration practitioners. Students will select aspects of arbitration law or practice or the controversies that surround it and write research papers on their topic of interest.

Modern doctrines attempting to reconcile federalism, the supremacy of federal law, separation of powers, and the specific jurisdictional limitations of Article III judicial power raise complex questions about the nature and scope of judicial review, remedies, the adversary system, and alternatives to adjudication, among other subjects.  This course is designed to allow students to deepen their expertise and explore discrete topics in a tutorial-style format with the instructor.  Individual topics will be selected on the basis of student interest in consultation with the instructor, appropriate reading will be selected for analysis and discussion (generally by using a canonical or innovative text as a springboard), and students will be guided in the development of novel doctrines, theories, and practical solutions to some of the most vexing issues in the field.  Evaluation will be based on participation in mentored research and tutorial engagement as well as the creativity, prose quality, and persuasiveness of the paper.  Students may take the course for 1-3 units.  The paper requirement is 10-12 pages for each unit.  Student electing 2 or 3 units should enroll in Section 02 (which can count for R-credit).  Class sessions to be scheduled in harmony with students' other course commitments.  Elements used in grading:  Written Assignments, Final Paper.  Prerequisite: Federal Courts.  CONSENT APPLICATION: To apply for this course, students must complete and submit a Consent Application Form available on the SLS website (Click Courses at the bottom of the homepage and then click Consent of Instructor Forms).

        "title": "Anatomy of the Opioid Litigation: A Case Study in Complex Litigation",
        "description": "Although easy to lose sight of in the midst of the Coronvirus epidemic, the United States is in the midst of an opioid addiction epidemic.  More than 10 million Americans 12 years and older are estimated to have misused opioids in 2018, most of which misuse was linked to prescription drugs. Approximately 47,000 Americans died of opioid overdoses in that year. Opioid use is reported to have peaked in 2011 but opioid addiction remains a problem in many parts of the country (CNN Editorial Research, &quot;Opioid Crisis Fast Facts,&quot;  June 21, 2020, available at https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/18/health/opioid-crisis-fast-facts/index.html).  The opioid crisis presents a variety of public policy challenges. Like the Crack epidemic of the 1980s, opioid misuse has had disproportionate effects on certain communities. While the former disproportionately affected poor Black urban communities and other urban communities of color, the latter has primarily affected poor White communities, particularly in non-coastal areas of the country. The former was met with popular criticism of its victims and draconian criminal justice policies that incarcerated a generation of Black Americans and other people of color. The latter has been met with an outpouring of concerned media commentary, and funding (however insufficient) for public treatment programs. It is difficult not to conclude that systemic engrained racism explains much of this difference.  The opioid crisis also differs from the crack crisis, however, in that opioid victims and their advocates have been able to target responsible parties and attempt to hold them accountable for the harm and losses their conduct has imposed on addicts, their families and their communities. It is widely agreed that the origin of the epidemic was the virtually unlimited distribution of prescription opioid drugs, allegedly encouraged by the drug manufacturers and enabled by other corporations in the pharmaceutical supply chain and by the physicians who prescribed the drugs. The opioid epidemic has also led to a wide-ranging litigation, which has taken as its role model earlier litigation against tobacco manufacturers and ongoing litigation against gun manufacturers. The opioid litigation stands as an example of joining private and public civil litigation to claim compensation for losses due to alleged wrongdoing by private corporations and in the process reshape public policy with regard to harm. To prevail against defendants, plaintiffs have had to persuade courts to apply liability doctrine in unusual although not entirely new ways.  Much of the litigation resulting from opioid overdoses and addiction has been contested in the federal courts, which have deployed an armamentarium of formal and informal procedural rules and practices developed over the past several decades to manage and resolve large-scale litigation. Innovative approaches have been adopted by the federal judge assigned to manage the litigation. Key defendants have chosen to manage their liability by seeking the protection of the bankruptcy courts.  In sum, the opioid litigation offers opportunities to consider the roles of socio-economic inequality and racial attitudes in shaping perceptions of harm, the potential of tort law to provide remedies for losses, and the challenge of pursuing remedies for mass loss in federal courts. Through readings, guest lectures, discussion and individual research papers on relevant topics of your choice, this seminar will provide both practical information about litigating mass tort claims and space to consider the appropriate role of courts in solving social policy problems.

Professors Pic&oacute; and Andino aim to enable students to compare the evidence principles of the common law, as practiced in the U.S. and U.K. and some British Commonwealth Countries, with the civil law evidence principles embraced in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.  The course will benefit students who someday may take part in transnational litigation or business transactions or will engage in cross-cultural research.  After a brief historical review of the development of these two procedural traditions, our focus will shift to an overview of civil law evidentiary principles with emphasis on the roles of the judge and parties in preparing the evidence.  Then we take up a comparison of rules governing character evidence, witness competency, hearsay, and scientific evidence, as well as evidentiary privileges and standards and burdens of proof.

Because of climate change, it is also increasingly clear that our energy sources must be sustainable. The focus of this course is on the electricity and natural gas industries, which operate in the U.S. under a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework involving extensive interplay between federal and state authorities. This course provides a strong grounding in the governing legal principles. It draws upon case-law, primarily decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court, to bring these principles into focus. We will examine the respective roles of regulation and market forces in this field. Students who complete the class will gain a historical understanding of how economic regulation of the energy industry has evolved since its origins in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, a durable conceptual understanding of current energy law and policy debates, and a practical grasp of the legal and regulatory framework for the energy industry in the US. Non-law students interested in energy issues are welcomed and encouraged to take this course, as an understanding of the legal framework is essential to careers in the energy sector.

This course focuses on societal management of the natural world and natural resources (e.g., energy, water, and living species).  Natural resource management presents extremely difficult and contentious issues of law and public policy.  Major debates rage over whether farmers should do with less water in order to protect endangered fish species, how to equitably allocate water and energy, and whether federal land agencies should emphasize preservation, recreation, or resource extraction.  This course is a survey course and will look at fish and wildlife protection (including the protection of endangered species), freshwater, energy, and public lands.  A major goal will be to look at the flaws in current management and how that management can be improved.  Class sessions will include both (1) critical examinations of current laws and policy and (2) in-depth discussions of situational case studies that force you to consider how you would address real-life issues.

        "title": "The Business of Water",
        "description": "Freshwater is our most crucial natural resource, but it is facing mounting pressures from climate change and other factors.  While public agencies traditionally dominated water management, private water companies are playing an increasingly important (and sometime controversial) role. In many cases, private companies are making critical contributions to meeting societal water needs (e.g., by developing new technologies and finding new ways to reduce water use).  In other cases, however, the involvement of private companies has proven controversial (e.g., when private companies have taken over public water supply systems in developing countries such as Bolivia). This course will look at established and emerging businesses in the water sector and the legal, economic, and social issues generated by the private sector's involvement. These businesses include water technology companies (e.g., companies commercializing new desalination or water recycling technologies), venture capitalists, water funds (that directly buy and sell water rights), consulting firms, innovative agricultural companies, and large corporations (that increasingly are adopting corporate stewardship programs).  The course will begin with two weeks of introduction to water and the private water sector.  After that, each class will focus on a different water company. Company executives will attend each class session and discuss their business with the class. In most classes, we will examine (1) the viability and efficacy of the company's business plan, (2) the legal and/or social issues arising from the business' work, and (3) how the business might contribute to improved water management and policy. Each student will be expected to write (1) two short reflection papers on businesses that visit the class, and (2) a 10- to15-page paper at the conclusion of the class on an idea that the student has for a new water company, on an existing water company of the student's choice, or on a legal or policy initiative that can improve the role that business plays in improving water management (either in a particular sector or more generally).

        "description": "(Formerly Law 774) This case study-oriented course will focus on the critical skills needed to evaluate, develop, finance (on a non-recourse basis), and complete grid-scale clean energy projects.  This course will be essentially the same as in the past four years (when it was cross-listed as GSB GEN 335).  This course is highly multi-disciplinary, both in terms of substance and student mix. The course has consistently had a significant mix of business, engineering, law and earth science students.  As in the past, the course will focus on the issues associated with the business of developing, financing, constructing and operating grid-scale clean energy projects.  The course will focus on what a project developer or lender (i.e., in either case, the business person) needs to know to develop and finance successful projects.  The project development business--far more than many other businesses such as tech, manufacturing, consumer, services, retail or transportation--inherently involves a VERY long list of highly-germane and critical legal issues.  We address the legal issues from the perspective of what a business person needs to understand in order to navigate them and complete a project.  The primary course materials will be documents from several representative projects -- e.g., solar, wind, storage, carbon capture, transmission, combined heat &amp; power -- covering key areas including market and feasibility studies, environmental permitting and regulatory decisions, financial disclosure from bank and bond transactions, and construction, input, and offtake contracts. For virtually every clean energy project, legal documents and financial/business models tend to highly customized. By examining actual projects and transactions we can learn how developers, financiers, and lawyers work to get deals over the finish line--deals that meet the demands of the market, the requirements of the law, and (sometimes) broader societal goals, in particular climate change, economic competitiveness, and energy security. Elements used in grading: Class Participation (35 %), Lecture-based Assignment (15 %), Group Project (50 %). Absences affect grade.  This class is limited to 36 students, with an effort made to have students from SLS, GSB, engineering and earth sciences.  (All students need to be graduate students.)  CONSENT APPLICATION: To apply for this course, students must complete and submit a Consent Application Form available on the SLS website (Click Courses at the bottom of the homepage and then click Consent of Instructor Forms).

        "description": "This interdisciplinary course integrates the legal, scientific, and policy dimensions of how we characterize and manage resource use and allocation along the California coast. We will use this geographic setting as the vehicle for exploring more generally how agencies, legislatures, and courts resolve resource-use conflicts and the role that scientific information and uncertainty play in the process. Our focus will be on the land-sea interface as we explore contemporary coastal land-use and marine resource decision-making, including coastal pollution, public health, ecosystem management; public access; private development; local community and state infrastructure; natural systems and significant threats; resource extraction; and conservation, mitigation and restoration. Students will learn the fundamental physics, chemistry, and biology of the coastal zone, tools for exploring data collected in the coastal ocean, and the institutional framework that shapes public and private decisions affecting coastal resources. There will be 3 to 4 written assignments addressing policy and science issues during the quarter, as well as a take-home final assignment. Special Instructions: In-class work and discussion is often done in interdisciplinary teams of students from the School of Law, the School of Engineering, the School of Humanities and Sciences, and the School of Earth, Energy, and Environmental Sciences. Students are expected to participate in class discussion and 2-3 Saturday field trips. Elements used in grading: Participation, including class session and field trip attendance, writing and quantitative assignments.

With a diminishing role of the federal government on environmental policy and regulation, it is up to sub-nationals like states and cities to lead innovation and deployment of clean energy, resilience strategies, water management, and more. This class will explore the evolving role of cities in advancing sustainability from the lens of law, policy, planning, and governance. Some of the topics we will discuss in-depth include climate mitigation, clean energy, green buildings, climate adaptation and resilience, water supply and reuse, land use and transportation, and more. Case studies will focus on U.S. cities with some emphasis on California. Overarching themes across all content areas include legal constraints of city authority, governance, socioeconomic tradeoffs, and the roles of various types of institutions in developing, advancing, and advocating for local policy change.

        "description": "While climate change is often considered an 'environmental problem', the risks and opportunities embedded in a changing climate go well beyond the natural environment. This course reframes climate as a macroeconomic challenge, one in which multilateral politics, global investment, and distribution of impacts must be understood and reconsidered. Based on readings and guest speakers, this interdisciplinary course traces the arc of climate past, present and future on the pillars of politics, finance, and infrastructure (both physical and institutional). Grounded in the latest climate science and the history of global climate negotiations, the bulk of the course investigates innovations at the intersection of finance, law and policy, with particular emphasis on risk management, legal liability, corporations, climate justice and resilience. The final sessions look to the future and consider how the next generation of leaders might solve the greatest challenge of our time. Elements used in grading: Students may take the course for 2 units (section 1) or 3 units (section 2). Section 1 and 2 students will receive grades for attendance, in class participation and guest-speaker questions. Section 1 students will complete a group presentation on the design of a financial, business, legal or policy intervention with the potential to reduce emissions on a large scale. Section 2 students will be required to write an individual research paper meeting the Law School's R paper requirements. This class is limited to 30 students, with an effort made to have students from SLS (15 students will be selected by lottery) and 15 non-law students by consent of instructor. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.",

The course will include units on: (1) toxic exposure and public health disparities stemming from the disproportionate siting of locally-unwanted land uses in poor neighborhoods of color; (2) access to natural resources and basic public services, including clean water, wastewater disposal, and open space; (3) tools in environmental justice advocacy (including community-based lawyering, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, common law nuisance actions, and transactional lawyering); (4) environmental justice issues in Indian Country, and (5) environmental justice issues in climate change policy.

This course will look at three issues covered in Natural Resources Law &amp; Policy from a comparative perspective, focusing on Cape Town, South Africa, and the region surrounding it.  First, we will look at the water challenges facing Cape Town, including (a) the supply limitations that led the city to warn in 2018 of a &quot;Day Zero&quot; when it would be forced to turn off everyone's taps and (b) the ongoing water equity issues facing the region's impoverished townships such as Khayelitsha.  Second, we will visit with companies and law firms seeking to promote renewable energy projects to discuss the issues that they face.  Finally, we will meet with environmental non-profits to examine South Africa's efforts to protect wildlife from poaching and other threats.  Students might also participate in small, half-day conference with the University of Stellenbosch examining these and related sustainability issues.  Elements used in grading:  TBA.

Among the many issues that we will consider are: how to allocate water during periods of scarcity (particularly as climate change leads to more extremes); alternative means of responding to the world's growing demands for water (including active conservation); the appropriate role for the market and private companies in meeting society's water needs; protection of threatened groundwater resources; environmental limits on water development (including the U.S. Endangered Species Act and the &quot;public trust&quot; doctrine); constitutional issues in water governance; the human right to water; Native American water rights; protection of water quality; challenges to the substantive reform of existing water law; and interstate and international disputes over water.

The seminar will meet six times during the Spring Quarter.  The heart of the series will include four seminars with panels of outside experts covering the following topics:  1) The diversification of California's water supply portfolio; 2) The rise of the coequal goals of ecosystem restoration and water supply reliability; 3) The ongoing tension between collaborative and adversarial decision-making processes; and 4) Implications for water researchers seeking to help define pathways to meaningful solutions.  In addition to these four seminar sessions, there will be an introductory California Water 101 session for students and a closing session on what we have learned.  Students will be assigned readings and required to develop questions for discussion.  Lead instructor for the seminar will be Landreth Visiting Fellow Dr. Timothy Quinn.  Dr. Quinn spent more than ten years as the executive director of the Association of California Water Agencies, and more than twenty years as the Deputy General Manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.  Over the course of that career, he was at the center of every major water management issue facing the state of California, including the state's use of Colorado River water, management of the Bay Delta, and sustainable groundwater management.

But how do they work?  How do they arise--why and how can corporations participate in these voluntary measures?  How do they regulate firm behavior and how can regulators police the tools themselves? This interdisciplinary seminar examines these questions and more, with readings from traditional legal sources (cases, agreements), as well as from economics, political science, and social psychology. Guest speakers and case studies will add real-world context to our exploration of theory.  Elements used in grading: Students may take the course for 2 units (section 1) or 3 units (section 2). Attendance, class participation, and short written assignments will factor into grades for both sections. Section 1 students will also prepare a private governance proposal and presentation.  Section 2 students will write a research paper meeting the Law School's R paper requirements.  After the term begins, students can transfer from section 1 to section 2, which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructors.

        "description": "The federal government owns and manages 28% of all land in the United States, and 48% in California, the third-highest percentage in the nation. How the federal government manages public lands therefore has profound implications for countless constituencies and users, affecting everything from recreation to conservation to more intensive uses such as mining, timber production, and cattle grazing. This seminar will explore the history, operation, power, and limits of America's federal public-land laws. We will focus on four specific types of public lands--national forests, BLM lands, national parks, and wildlife refuges, learning about the governing laws of each and using modern-day controversies to examine how those laws work in practice and whether (and how) they need changing. We will also devote attention to the historic and present-day exclusion of (and injustices toward) Indigenous peoples and tribes in our public-lands system and opportunities for repair and inclusion moving forward. Readings and discussion, which together will form the backbone of this small seminar, will range from case law to policy papers to pleadings in litigated cases, and throughout the seminar students will complete short assignments tied to the subjects we cover.

This course will examine the environmental justice movement and its relationship to tribal sovereignty and the federal trust responsibility. Students will learn how environmental justice for Native peoples is integral to the legacy of colonization, lack of financial and technical resources for Tribes, and changing federal Indian law policies in U.S.  history. This course also seeks to understand how Indigenous movements and activism seek to achieve environmental justice in multiple contexts, including the NODAPL movement, natural resource extraction, protection of water resources, and Indigenous responses to climate change. Students will gain a deep understanding of the challenges faced and lessons learned by Indigenous peoples in their fight of environmental justice.

        "description": "Ambitious new federal and state laws and policies are incentivizing a rapid transition of the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels toward clean energy. This course, open to law school students and graduate students from other schools, will survey the legal and policy tools that are being deployed to accelerate a massive shift toward clean energy in all sectors of the economy, and the associated technological, financial, legal and equity challenges associated with building out the clean energy economy. We will review the key incentive- and regulatory-based mechanisms that are driving the transition in major sectors of the U.S. economy--including transportation, electricity, industry, and buildings. Special focus will be placed on siting, permitting, and financial challenges (and opportunities) for utility-scale and distributed clean energy sources; expansion of the transmission grid; and the potential scale-up of new technologies to speed the transition, including nuclear and hydrogen-based power. The course will include guest appearances by governmental officials and opinion leaders who are working to facilitate the build-out of clean energy infrastructure in the U.S. Grades will reflect class participation, two short reaction papers, and a final paper.

        "title": "Health Law: Improving Public Health",
        "description": "This course examines how the law can be used to improve the public's health. The broad questions explored are: what authority does the government have to regulate in the interest of public health? How are individual rights balanced against this authority? What are the benefits and pitfalls of using laws and litigation to achieve public health goals? The course investigates these questions as they operate in a range of specific contexts, including preventing and controlling infectious diseases; preventing obesity; reducing tobacco use; ensuring access to medical care; reducing firearm injuries; addressing the opioid epidemic; and responding to public health emergencies like COVID-19.  In examining these contexts, we will ask and answer questions such as, what do the Constitution and key statutes permit? What makes a good public health law? Where do we see success stories--and failures--in public health law? What ethical and economic arguments justify government intervention to shape individuals' and companies' health-related behaviors? Instruction is through interactive lectures with a significant amount of class discussion and some group exercises. Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Exam. This class is limited to 30 students, with an effort made to have students from SLS (25 students by lottery) and 5 non-law students by consent of the instructor.  Cross-listed with Medicine (MED 237).",

Why do vast inequalities persist in who has access to biomedical innovations, and in what kinds of innovations are brought to market? In this seminar we will examine the economics of biomedical R&amp;D and the legal institutions that are designed to incentivize and allocate access to new advances, with an emphasis on drugs and vaccines. We will consider legal tools including patents and other intellectual property, FDA-administered regulatory exclusivity, prizes, grants, tax incentives, and subsidized health insurance. The current U.S. policy mix of innovation incentives and access allocation mechanisms is far from perfect, and students will have the opportunity to discuss reform proposals with experts involved in real-world biomedical innovation in different sectors.

        "description": "Asking questions is at the core of the role of an attorney. Whether it is interrogating a witness in a deposition, or conducting a direct or cross examination at trial, knowing how to ask a question is an essential lawyering skill. We'll explore textual materials and real life case examples in transcripts, videotape and cinema to determine the principals and best practices for questioning. We'll learn how to prepare for questioning; how to focus, narrow, and broaden an examination; how to obtain key admissions; how to deal with a difficult opponent; when to stop asking; and how to use what's been obtained in court or otherwise to win for your clients. This course will give you the skills and tools needed for the critical roles of questioning, which has broad applicability for trial lawyers and non trial lawyers alike.

        "description": "This seminar will explore the intellectual foundations of the institution of insurance, including the following key questions: How is insurance to be conceived: from a contract perspective? a tort perspective? a private governmental perspective? Correlatively, what are the economic and ethical dimensions of risk classifications and management? How serious are the concerns about moral hazard and adverse selection---core concepts of insurance law? What standards should be used to resolve insurance bad faith claims?  And, when a party is sued and the liability insurer controls the party's defense, how should the defense lawyer hired by the insurer navigate---and conceive of---this triangular relationship? The pervasive role of insurance in addressing societal concerns about accidental harm is vitally important but has been remarkably under-examined in the traditional law school curriculum.  Special Instructions: Grades will be based on class attendance, class participation, and either several short reflection papers (section (01)) or an independent research paper (section (02)). After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

        "title": "The Civil Justice System as an Agent of Change",
        "description": "The past 60 years have witnessed a dramatic expansion in the role of the courts as an agent of change in the United States. Constitutional, civil and economic rights have been created, such as marriage equality and strict liability in tort, but rights have also been limited through statutory restrictions and other means. The role of the judge has grown to activist and administrator in cases such as prison reform and housing desegregation. And through it all, it has been lawyers who have fought, won, and lost the battles of expansion and contraction of rights and remedies. Where the government fails to protect us, private practitioners serve a crucial role in challenging the legal &quot;status quo&quot; through civil litigation; vindication of a particular client's claim can simultaneously establish or clarify the rights in question on a societal scale.  Taught by an experienced trial lawyer, along with guests from both plaintiff and defense practices, course readings and discussion will draw on a wealth of textual, law review, and lay media, and the arc of relevant case law, including real trial experiences and litigation documents. This course explores changes in motor vehicle and commercial product safety, medical malpractice, police misconduct, civil rights, marital rights, sexual harassment and abuse, firearms liability, school and housing desegregation, college hazing, privacy, school funding and consumer safety. We'll study the titanic struggle over appropriate remedies for wrongs in these substantive areas, ranging from immunity to limits on recoveries, compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. We'll also study how a plaintiff or defense lawyer can make a difference for their clients and others similarly situated to catalyze significant societal improvement.

And responsible party disasters dominate the headlines, generating fear and a sense of disbelief. Both prospective preventive measures, and retrospective restorative efforts on behalf of victims, raise enormously difficult questions of how best to address these momentous events.  This seminar will examine preventive measures and remedial relief for natural disasters, such as pandemics (COVID) wildfires, floods, and hurricanes. Similarly, we will focus on preventive and remedial relief in responsible party disasters, such as acts of terrorism, oil spills, and release of toxic substances.

        "description": "This course covers the legal, public policy, and ethical issues that concern artists, art dealers, auction houses, museums, collectors, and others who comprise the world of visual art. Our focus will be on artists' rights (including copyright, resale royalties, moral rights, and freedom of expression issues), how the markets in art function (such as the artist-dealer relationship, auction rules, and issues faced by collectors), and the legal and ethical rules governing the collection, donation, and display of visual art, particularly for museums and their donors. The course focuses on certain recurrent themes: How do statutes and courts define (or attempt to define) art, and how is art defined differently for different legal purposes? How does the special character of art justify or require different treatment under the law from that accorded other tangible personal property, and how does (and should) the expressive nature of art affect the way it is owned, protected, regulated, or funded? We anticipate having two or three visitors to the class during the quarter, such as a gallery owner, auctioneer, and museum director. In addition, we will also have the students participate in one or two interactive negotiation simulation exercises inspired by real situations and controversies in the art world. Graduate students from other departments and schools are welcome to take this course with the permission of the instructors. Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance, final exam.",

        "title": "Law and Culture in American Fiction",
        "description": "How do we identify an owner?  What does a citizen look like?  Whose privacy requires protection?  The stories we tell about the experience of being Americans bolster and undermine particular legal arguments and conclusions. In the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth, novels were an important source of these narratives. And over the last century movies, television and other forms of visual storytelling have recycled these stock narratives countless times.  In this interdisciplinary seminar, a novel or story is paired with a contemporary legal text (and often historical material for context) each week.  These pairings track the maintenance of personal identity, community stability, and even linguistic meaning across shifting legal constructions of citizenship, race, gender, and class; changes in the law of property, contract, and privacy; and other legal and extralegal  deployments of the (violent) authority of the state.  The writers whose work we will consider include James Fenimore Cooper, Herman Melville, Henry James, William Faulkner, Nella Larsen, John Okada, Katherine Anne Porter and Sherman Alexie.  (These authors are known for great writing and cultural influence, but also, in some cases, overt racism and personal misconduct.)  Reading and writing with an increased awareness of the background narratives implicit in our legal arguments is among the goals of the course.  Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance, and written assignments. Automatic grading penalty waived for writers. For Research &quot;R&quot; credit, students may petition to complete one long paper based on independent research with consent of the instructor.",

        "description": "The conventions of legal writing and reasoning taught in law school derive from a long tradition of argument and persuasion. This interdisciplinary seminar locates legal conventions in that broader intellectual history, starting with Aristotle and tracing (some of) the ruptures and continuities that have shaped our particular practices. The way we argue matters. The form we give our statements determines not just whether but whom they will persuade. So we will develop a tool kit for identifying the available means of persuasion, crafting sentences and paragraphs that suit the ideas they contain, voicing those ideas with an eye to audience and purpose as well as authority; noticing the way the language we choose implies a social world in which the argument unfolds. The goal is to become both more effective and more conscious in our deployment of those conventions -- as readers, speakers and writers.

        "description": "When we represent our experience today, we do so as much through images as language. When we seek to persuade, we offer photographs, charts, videos. When we witness misconduct, we pull out our smartphones. And as images saturate our cultural discourse, they are increasingly part of legal practice. The power of an image often lies in its apparent simplicity: we know it when we see it. But how much of what we see is produced by the biases and expectations -- the habits of viewing -- that we bring to the encounter? What is left out when an infographic distills information for us? Lawyers and judges have historically tended to treat certain kinds of images as unmediated representations of reality, even though neuroscience, empirical research, and cultural theory all refute this so-called reality effect. Such na&iuml;ve realism maps on to an ideal of definitive proof embedded in the adversary system. And it haunts our efforts to adapt legal practice to visual persuasion in ways that are consistent with our rule of law values, even as Covid has quickly normalized video trials and social media increasingly serves as the court of public opinion. This interdisciplinary seminar tracks the legal reception of modern visual representation from confusion about the admissibility of photographs in the late 19th century (is it like a drawing? is it like eyewitness testimony?) to the trials of O.J Simpson and the police officers that assaulted Rodney King in the 1990s (how does race affect our perception of trails? do judges and jurors decide differently when the proceedings are televised?) to the frequent and strategic deployment of visual media in pretrial and litigation practice today. We will also consider the roles of visual persuasion in areas of doctrine (like privacy, qualified immunity, and freedom of speech) as well as applications in practice (like contracts and client communications). Throughout the quarter, we will attend to the ways American visual culture has resisted and reinforced systemic racism and inequality.

Lawyers at various stages in their careers have their own personal myths, sometimes conscious and sometimes not. These personal myths embody key tendencies that determine or heavily influence each lawyer's personal and professional path.  This course uses some salient collective myths as well as modern psychological material to create a powerful backdrop for self-examination and self-development. It offers a space and time for each student to consider his or her own personal and professional direction through the course materials, class interactions, and a series of reflection papers. The course benefits from the collaboration of Ron Tyler, Director of the Criminal Defense Clinic, who will conduct a session focusing on mindfulness practices.

But there often isn't enough attention devoted in law school either to thinking creatively or to reflecting in a creative way on the issues students confront inside and outside the classroom. This course will respond to this gap by building a bridge between law and the arts, with the goal of helping students hone their ability to think creatively and use disciplined imagination. Law &amp; Creativity will meet twice a week and have dual components designed to inform one another. The first session will be structured as a seminar in which students gather to examine and discuss creative treatments of legal and professional issues in a variety of media (including film, fiction, and nonfiction). The second session will follow the creative-writing workshop model in which students submit their own fiction and creative nonfiction pieces for group discussion. Through the workshop process, students will develop the skills necessary to constructively critique and workshop one another's work, and learn a variety of techniques for improving their own creative writing.

        "description": "After its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s, many wondered whether the law and literature movement would retain vitality. Within the last decade there has, however, been an explosion of energy in the field, which has expanded beyond the boundaries of the literary text narrowly conceived and incorporated a range of other genres and humanistic approaches. Several recent or forthcoming books survey the range of emerging scholarship and the potential for new directions within the field.  Using one of these--New Directions in Law and Literature (Oxford, 2017)--as a guide, this course will delve into a variety of topics that law and literature approaches can illuminate. These include, among others, conceptions of sovereignty and non-sovereign collectivities, the construction of the citizen and refugee, competing visions of marriage and its alternatives, law and the rhetorical tradition, and theoretical perspectives on intellectual property. Nearly every session will pair recent scholarship in the field with a literary or artistic work, ranging from Claudia Rankine's Citizen to Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

        "description": "This one credit course, based on materials taught at the Aspen Institute, will read and discuss selected classical Greek documents (in translation, of course) of particular relevance to the contemporary practice of law. We will begin with a reading of two Platonic dialogues -- Crito and the Apologia -- to frame the question of whether Socrates should have resisted the lawful, but unjust, verdict condemning him to death. We'll focus of the tension between law and justice, perhaps peeking forward to Melville's Billy Budd, and MLK Jr.'s Letter from the Birmingham Jail.  We will continue with the third play in Aeschylus' Oresteia, focusing on the decision to remit Orestes to the judgment of the people of Athens, rather than to the Furies, in connection with the murder of Clytemnestra. We'll focus on the decision to vest secular authorities with the definition of justice.  We'll close with a reading of Antigone, focusing on the relationship between the individual and the state, and the gendered nature of justice. I often end the seminar with an informal public reading of the Antigone. I play Creon, maybe this year in a Trump mask.  I anticipate five meetings, usually over dinner in one of the seminar rooms.  Class will meet five Wednesdays, 6:15PM-8:15pm, April 11, April 25, May 9, May 23, May 30.  Discussion will be informal, and non-hierarchical.

It will be structured as a continuing dialogue between recent debates about regulation and finance, and historical debates over the role of law in capitalist development.  It will touch upon the regulation of corporations, banking and the financial system, movements for deregulation in the 1970s, 80s and 90s, the roots of the financial crisis of 2007-08, and its aftermath up to the present day.  The seminar will be structured as a short and necessarily tentative (given the time constraints of the course) examination of the social, institutional and intellectual history of economic regulation, as a means of contextualizing our continuing and unresolved arguments over scope and purpose of corporations and the financial sector.

        "title": "Media, Technology, and the First Amendment",
        "description": "The right to free speech is meaningless without spaces to exercise it. Over the past decades, electronic media---broadcast radio and television, cable television, telephony, and the internet---have become critical spaces where Americans speak to and with each other.  Today, being able to speak and be heard online is as important as being able to speak in parks, sidewalks, and public squares. As the Supreme Court has recognized, social media platforms &quot;provide perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen to make his or her voice heard,&quot; so that any citizen may &quot;become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox.&quot; Packingham v. North Carolina, 137 S. Ct. 1730, 1737 (2017).  But while the public squares of the colonies were public spaces, the social media platforms hosting much of Americans' online speech today are owned by private actors with their own First Amendment rights. And court decisions about electronic media differ significantly from the precedents governing leaflets, pickets, soapboxes, and flag burning that dominated the twentieth century.  This class complements the law school's general First Amendment class by focusing on precedents governing speech on electronic media (broadcast, cable, telephony, and the internet) and what they mean for free speech in the digital age. The answer is hotly debated by policy makers, scholars, and courts. As Justice Alito noted in his recent dissent when the Supreme Court put Texas' social media law back on hold, &quot;It is not at all obvious how our existing precedents, which predate the age of the internet, should apply to large social media companies.&quot; In this course, we will take on that thorny task.  We will grapple with questions such as: Why can comedians swear on Netflix or cable TV, but not on broadcast TV? Can politicians or government officials block Americans from their Twitter or Facebook accounts? Do internet platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube violate their users' First Amendment rights when they take down or restrict access to content? And how does the First Amendment affect attempts to regulate internet platforms such as Texas' and Florida's social media laws?  Who should take this class: If you are interested in the First Amendment, constitutional issues, appellate litigation, media and technology law, communications law, net neutrality, the increasing power of internet platforms, or simply use the internet, this class is for you.  There are no prerequisites for this class. You can take it before or after the general First Amendment class. The class is open to first year law students and graduate students from other schools. To apply for this course, non-Law students must complete a Non-Law Student Add Request Form available on the SLS Registrar's Office website (see Non-Law Students).

        "title": "Current Issues in Network Neutrality",
        "description": "Due to the change in administration, the future of net neutrality in the US is in question again. Network neutrality rules are based on a simple principle: Internet service providers like Verizon or Comcast that connect us to the Internet should not control what happens on the Internet. Net neutrality rules prohibit ISPs from blocking or slowing down websites, making some sites more attractive than others, or charging sites fees to reach people faster.  After a long, public fight that mobilized more than 4 million people across the political spectrum, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted strong net neutrality rules in February 2015. Now these rules might be on the chopping block. FCC Chairman Pai, who opposed the rules when they were adopted, has declared his intention to roll back the rules, while expressing some support for &quot;net neutrality principles.&quot; At the same time, Republicans in Congress have indicated they might consider a legislative solution.  Through lectures, class discussions, and guest speakers, the seminar will introduce students to the key questions underlying the net neutrality debate so that they can become informed participants in this debate. Do we need net neutrality rules, and, if yes, what should they be? What are the options for addressing net neutrality at the FCC and in Congress? How do past court decisions constrain the FCC's options for adopting net neutrality rules? While the class focuses on the net neutrality debate in the U.S., the underlying policy questions are general and directly applicable to ongoing net neutrality debates around the world.  The class is open to law students and students from other parts of the university. Students do not need to have any technical background to participate in the class; any necessary background will be taught in class.

It is fundamental to Silicon Valley and beyond, including in software, mobile, consumer devices, autonomous cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. This is a practice-oriented course covering the fundamentals of licensing technology and patents, including business considerations, drafting, negotiations and strategic considerations. We will also consider the role of licensing in mergers and acquisitions, litigation and antitrust contexts. The course is structured based on a real-world hypothetical involving entrepreneurs who spin out university-developed inventions into startup companies and then seek to commercialize the technology and patents to leading companies in a specified technology industry (such as smartphones, autonomous cars, &quot;internet of things&quot; or the like). We will also have a guest lecturer from a major technology company with significant licensing dimensions (which in the past have included Google, Facebook, Waymo, and Qualcomm).

The course covers existing and emerging privacy torts, applicable and proposed privacy legislation and regulations, international norms and extraterritorial application of privacy law such as in the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, and self-regulation of privacy through technological means, contracts or other means.  We will discuss all of these things, as well as incorporate developments in the news, from the perspective of the various privacy stakeholders--consumers, regulators and business.

We will focus on U.S. government signals collection for national security, intelligence gathering, espionage, criminal law enforcement and public safety purposes, and will address transnational implications.  Technologies and practices we will cover include wiretapping, stored data collection and mining, location tracking, encryption and developing eavesdropping techniques.  We will explore how government surveillance is permitted, prohibited or controlled by the U.S. Constitution, including the Fourth Amendment, and laws such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the USA Freedom Act, the Patriot Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the CLOUD Act, and CALEA.  We will also look at the role of executive orders and laws outside the United States.  No technical expertise is required.

        "description": "(Formerly Law 769)  Strategic lawyering in the 21st century requires a combination of critical skillsets, including facility with technology, product design, partnerships, dispute resolution, and policy. No issue in the digital age has demonstrated this better than the history of and litigation surrounding Google Books. For over a decade, from the inception of the product to the resolution of its legal issues, lawyers were integrally involved with engineers and the business every step of the way. They helped design its features, defend it from lawsuits, craft a settlement, and advocate complementary policy positions.  On a broader level, the history of ebooks is a microcosm of the opportunities and challenges of the digital age: new technologies to reproduce and distribute works, changing consumer norms, massive disruptions to economic interests, evolving concepts of fair use, increased access to information, fears about piracy, and threats to competition. Every one of these issues requires skilled lawyering in close partnership with business leadership.  This seminar will focus on strategic lawyering at the cutting edge of innovation by closely studying, among other things, the history of Google Books and the evolution of copyright in the digital age. We will look at how leading businesses, including Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, have each used law, litigation, and policy as tools to advance their business interests. We will focus on developments related to ebooks, and also study analogous issues involving the music, movie, and newspaper industries.  The seminar will include guest speakers who have led legal strategies to further innovation. Some copyright experience is helpful but not essential. The course is open to graduate students throughout the university, especially the Graduate School of Business, the Department of Communication, and the Journalism Program.  Special Instructions: Students on the waitlist for the course will be admitted if spots are available on the basis of their position on the waitlist and degree of study.  Elements used in grading:  Grading will be based upon weekly reflections, class participation, and a short final paper (or, for those opting for Research credit, a longer paper based on independent research). A version of this course was taught at Stanford Law School in 2015 and Harvard Law School in 2016.

        "description": "The internet has enabled new forms of innovation, content production and political participation that are transforming our economy, society and democratic system. Technical, legal and economic choices will affect whether the Internet can realize its potential or not.  Communications law - the law that governs both the physical infrastructures for communications services such as cable and telephone networks as well as the communication services which are provided over these infrastructures - has become one of the most important arenas in which choices affecting the future of the information society are made. The debates over network neutrality or the right ways to foster broadband deployment are examples of this trend.  At the same time, the Internet's ability to support a variety of different communications services such as telephony, information services or video over the same physical network infrastructure challenges the existing communications law, which is based on the assumption that different physical infrastructures offer different communications services.  What can regulators and legislators do to allow the Internet to realize its economic, social, cultural, and political potential? How can we foster the deployment of more broadband networks? And how can policymakers allow applications like Internet telephony and traditional telephony to coexist without giving one an unfair advantage over the other? The course will address how current law deals with these questions, but also explore what regulators and legislators may do to better deal with the challenges posed by the Internet. The course is mostly focused on the US, but highlights developments elsewhere where appropriate.  Special Instructions: Students may take Communications Law: Internet and Telephony and Communications Law: Broadcast and Cable Television in any order (neither is a prerequisite for the other). There are no prerequisites for this course. No technical background is required.  Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance, final exam.",

The class brings in real inventors and patent examiners to give students a real-world experience of developing a patent, understanding patentability, building patent portfolios, and getting a patent application prosecuted through the patent office. Students will interact with inventors in a startup-type environment and help the startup protect the IP in its technology -- through interactions with the inventors to identify and develop concepts and draft corresponding patent applications, and through interactions with the PTO to get the patents assessed against prior art and eventually granted.  The course is open to all students, regardless of your technical (or non-technical) undergraduate background. All you require is an interest in technology or patent law. This class will give you a solid understanding of what patents are, provide real-life experience in identifying and helping companies protect the IP in their technologies, and help you understand the mechanics of patent structure and development, all of which will be helpful experience and background for students interested in pursuing any technology-based litigation or transactional practices.

Trade secret laws have ancient origins but are more important than ever as a key component of intellectual property protection.  Technology plays a larger role in industry every day, while information can be downloaded and shared more easily than ever before.  These facts, combined with stricter limits on patentable subject matter and patent damages, have led companies to increasingly rely on trade secrets to protect their intellectual property and to an explosion of trade secret litigation.  In this class we will examine the law and the theory of trade secret protection, and will emphasize the practical aspects of protecting information as a trade secret and litigating trade secret cases. We will also explore the increasingly important subject of protecting trade secrets internationally. We will feature weekly guest speakers, several of whom have played key roles in the most prominent trade secret cases of the past decade.  The list includes individuals from the FBI, the Department of Justice, the judiciary, in-house counsel, and a forensic discovery expert, each of whom will address trade secret law and practice from their own unique perspective. We will highlight topics of current interest such as non-competition agreements, trade secrets and the Internet, and cybercrime, all while answering critical questions like, &quot;Can you rummage through your competitor's trash?&quot;. The class will be of interest to students who expect to practice intellectual property law, for students who expect to be involved in corporate transactions and labor law, and for anyone who wonders what they will be allowed to take with them when they leave their next employer.

        "title": "Internet Platforms and Free Expression",
        "description": "In recent years, Internet platforms like Facebook, Google, or Twitter have increasingly come under fire. Top executives from these companies have testified before Congress about their role in spreading misinformation in the 2016 elections. With the increased scrutiny come diverse calls for change. They include asking the platforms to self-regulate, asking regulators to address the platforms' growing market power, or asking Congress to adopt laws regulating various aspects of the platforms' behavior.  The seminar explores the many ways in which Internet platforms shape free expression online and asks what public responsibilities these private companies do and should have. By interrogating the structural role that these companies play in society -- are they quasi-state actors? are they the press? are they monopolies? -- we will assess how the platforms contribute to (or possibly mitigate) key social problems. We will critically examine constitutional and statutory laws, like the First Amendment, CDA 230, and antitrust law to evaluate whether and how they facilitate or constrain possible solutions. And with the benefit of guest speakers from academia and policy sectors, we will draw our own conclusions about how to best ensure platform accountability.  tl;dr: If you want to work at a tech law firm, in-house at a tech company, in a regulatory position vis-a-vis the tech sector, or are generally interested in critical questions around the role of Internet platforms in society and their impact on free expression online, this class is for you. We hope to see your application!  Special Instructions: Enrollment will be limited to 15 students from both SLS and H&amp;S. Experience with First Amendment doctrine is helpful, but not required. Grades will be based on class attendance, class participation, and either a number of shorter reflection papers (section (01)) or an independent research paper (section (02)). After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2 or 3 units, depending on paper length. Elements used in grading: Class participation, class attendance, reflection papers or research paper.

        "description": "Copyright law is the primary legal regime governing human creativity, and it plays some role in nearly all creative industries today. Consequently, copyright law has far-reaching economic and cultural implications. In this seminar, we will consider the interests of some of the different groups affected by the copyright regime, including creators, technologists, audiences, institutions, and heirs. Course readings will cover copyright case law and scholarship; research on creative practices and relevant business models; the role of copyright law in innovation policy; and legal versus extralegal modes of protecting the fruits of creative labor. Throughout, we will assess the fairness, efficacy, and alignment of copyright protection and remedies available, to whom, when, and for what reasons. The course aims to deepen students' knowledge of copyright law and scholarship; to equip students to develop principled policy arguments about the scope of copyright protection; and to enable students to evaluate reforms and alternatives to copyright in light of how these might serve different entities in the copyright ecosystem.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section 01 (written assignments) into section 02 (research paper), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

This course takes the examples of driverless cars and artificial intelligence and examines the new and challenging legal questions and opportunities presented by these technologies.  We will also discuss how business leaders, lawyers and technologists in these areas can navigate and create legal, regulatory and policy environments designed to help their businesses not only survive but thrive.  Through a combination of readings, classroom discussions, expert guest speakers from the relevant technology and policy fields and student presentations, this course explores the promise of these technologies, the legal and regulatory challenges presented and the levers in-house counsel and business leaders in these fields can invoke to better navigate the inevitable obstacles facing these highly disruptive technologies.  There are no formal prerequisites in engineering or law required, but students should be committed to pursuing novel questions in an interdisciplinary context.

        "description": "Patent reform has been a hotly debated topic in recent years in the intellectual property field.  Different industries and players have differing and often competing views of our patent system--how effective it is in promoting innovation and what, if any, reform is needed.  Students will play the role of counsel on one or more teams representing the interests of particular stakeholder groups. The teams will engage in a series of mock negotiations on actual legislative or administrative patent reform proposals with other teams, as well as mock legislative or administrative engagements before Congress or the United States Patent and Trademark Office respectively.  The goal is to achieve consensus on patent reforms that best serve the stakeholders' individual and collective interests, all in an environment of competing interests. Through experience-based learning and simulations, students will gain an understanding of some of the most current patent policy issues being debated in Congress and before the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  This seminar will also teach students how to: (1) evaluate from their client's perspective complex, legislative and administrative, patent policy proposals; and (2) strategize, prepare for, participate in, negotiate and advocate for beneficial reforms.  Prerequisites:  Introduction to Intellectual Property.  Grading Criteria: The seminar requires that students to do the required reading, actively participate in class and the mock negotiations and legislative or administrative engagements, and write a series of at least three short assignments.",

Is sovereignty in cyberspace different than in other domains, and can states meaningfully defend their sovereignty in cyberspace? Is hacking back against cyber thieves the legal equivalent of defending one's own property? How should states respond to cyber espionage and information operations, and what legal options are available? This course explores the domestic and international law of cyberspace and its application to significant practical challenges. It also addresses broader legal policy questions, including the extent to which law acts as a constraint on state and non-state actors in cyberspace, whether the application of existing law to cyber activities is sufficient or new laws and norms are needed, and how they could be developed. Policy and law students are welcome; no previous legal knowledge is required.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, class participation, writing assignments, and a final exam.

        "title": "Regulating Artificial Intelligence",
        "description": "Even just a generation ago, interest in &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; (AI) was largely confined to academic computer science, philosophy, engineering research and development efforts, and science fiction. Today the term is widely understood to encompass not only long-term efforts to simulate the kind of general intelligence humans reflect, but also fast-evolving technologies (such as elaborate convolutional neural networks leveraging vast amounts of data) increasingly affecting finance, transportation, health care, national security, advertising and social media, and a variety of other fields. Conceived for students with interest in law, business, public policy, design, and ethics, this highly interactive course surveys current and emerging legal and policy problems related to how law structures humanity's relationship to artificially-constructed intelligence.  To deepen students' understanding of current and medium-term problems in this area, the course explores definitions and foundational concepts associated with &quot;artificial intelligence,&quot; likely directions for the evolution of AI, and different types of legally-relevant concerns raised by those developments and by the use of existing versions of AI.  We will consider distinct settings where regulation of AI is emerging as a challenge or topic of interest, including autonomous vehicles, autonomous weapons, AI in social media/communications platforms, and systemic AI safety problems; doctrines and legal provisions relevant to the development, control, and deployment of AI such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation; the connection between the legal treatment of manufactured intelligence and related bodies of existing law, such as administrative law, torts, constitutional principles, criminal justice, and international law; and new legal arrangements that could affect the development and use of AI.  We will also cover topics associated with the development and design of AI as they relate to the legal system, such as measuring algorithmic bias and explainability of AI models.  Cross-cutting themes will include: how law affects the way important societal decisions are justified, the balance of power and responsibility between humans and machines in different settings, the incorporation of multiple values into AI decision making frameworks, the interplay of norms and formal law, the technical complexities that may arise as society scales deployment of AI systems, and similarities and differences to other domains of human activity raising regulatory trade-offs and affected by technological change.  Note: The course is designed both for students who want a survey of the field and lack any technical knowledge, as well as for students who want to gain tools and ideas to deepen their existing interest or background in the topic. Students with longer-term interest in or experience with the subject are welcome to do a more technically-oriented paper or project in connection with this class. But technical knowledge or familiarity with AI is not a prerequisite, as various optional readings and some in-class material will help provide necessary background. Requirements: The course involves a mix of lectures, in-class activities, and student-led discussion and presentations. Requirements include attendance, participation in planning and conducting at least one student-led group presentation or discussion, two short 3-5 pp. response papers for other class sessions, and either an exam or a 25-30 pp. research paper.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer, with consent of the instructor, from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement. CONSENT APPLICATION: We will try to accommodate as many people as possible with interest in the course. But to facilitate planning and confirm your level of interest, please fill out an application (available at https://bit.ly/2MJIem9) by TBA.

        "description": "In our hyper-networked world dominated by digital gatekeepers, tech policy implicates the law, business, engineering and --- perhaps foremost --- society. Effective lawyering in the field must be multi-dimensional and incorporate economic, technological, societal and historical perspectives on the issues. This reading group will put these principles into action by examining current tech policy issues through these lenses. Past offerings of the reading group examined breaking issues such as Facebook and Cambridge Analytica (data collection and use); Uber and the Arizona pedestrian death (testing of AI); Amazon and antitrust (competition online); Apple and iPhone encryption (privacy vs. security); and LinkedIn and public user data (platform control and data ownership). Some possible topics this year include AI and facial recognition; social networks and political advertising; and Google, Apple and digital competition. The reading group does not require a technology background --- just interest in gaining a deeper understanding of the issues. It will meet every other week starting week 1 (weeks 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9) on Thursdays, 6:30PM to 8:30PM. Grading (MP/R/F) will be based on attendance and class participation.

        "title": "Lawyering for Innovation: Artificial Intelligence",
        "description": "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made the jump from science fiction to technical viability to product reality. Industries as far flung as finance, transportation, defense, and healthcare invest billions in the field. Patent filings for robotics and machine learning applications have surged. And policymakers are beginning to grapple with technologies once confined to the realm of computer science, such as predictive analytics and neural networks. AI's rise to prominence came thanks to a confluence of factors. Increased computing power, large-scale data collection, and advancements in machine learning---all accompanied by dramatic decreases in costs---have resulted in machines that now have the ability to exhibit complex &quot;intelligent&quot; behaviors. They can navigate in real-world environments, process natural language, diagnose illnesses, predict future events, and even conquer strategy games. These abilities, in turn, have allowed companies and governments to entrust machines with responsibilities once exclusively reserved for humans---including influencing hiring decisions, bail release conditions, loan considerations, medical treatment and police deployment. But with these great new powers, of course, come great new responsibilities. The first public deployments of AI have seen ample evidence of the technology's disruptive---and destructive---capabilities. AI-powered systems have killed and maimed, filled social networks with hate, and been accused of shaping the course of elections. And as the technology proliferates, its governance will increasingly fall upon lawyers involved in the design and development of new products, oversight bodies and government agencies. AI is the biggest addition to technology law and policy since the rise of the internet, and its influence spreads far beyond the tech sector. As such, those entering practice in a wide variety of fields need to understand AI from the ground up in order to competently assess and influence its policy, legal and product implications as deployments scale across industries in the coming years. This course is designed to teach precisely that. It seeks to equip students with an understanding of the basics of AI and machine learning systems by studying the implications of the technology along the design/deployment continuum, moving from (1) system inputs (data collection) to (2) system design (engineering) and finally to (3) system outputs (product features). This input/design/output framework will be used throughout the course to survey substantive engineering, policy and legal issues arising at each of those key stages. In doing so, the course will span topics including privacy, bias, discrimination, intellectual property, torts, transparency and accountability. The course will also feature leading experts from a variety of AI disciplines and professional backgrounds. An important aspect of the course is gaining an understanding of the technical underpinnings of AI, which will be packaged in an easy-to-understand, introductory manner with no prior technical background required. The writing assignments will center on reflection papers on legal, regulatory and policy analysis of current issues involving AI. The course will be offered for two units of credit (H/P/R/F). Grading will be determined by attendance, class participation and written assignments. Given the course's multi-disciplinary focus, students outside of the law school, particularly those studying computer science, engineering or business, are welcome.

        "description": "Recent advances in computing may place us at the threshold of a unique turning point in human history. Soon we are likely to entrust management of our environment, economy, security, infrastructure, food production, healthcare, and to a large degree even our personal activities, to artificially intelligent computer systems. The prospect of &quot;turning over the keys&quot; to increasingly autonomous systems raises many complex and troubling questions. How will society respond as versatile robots and machine-learning systems displace an ever-expanding spectrum of blue- and white-collar workers? Will the benefits of this technological revolution be broadly distributed or accrue to a lucky few? How can we ensure that these systems are free of algorithmic bias and respect human ethical principles? What role will they play in our system of justice and the practice of law? How will they be used or abused in democratic societies and autocratic regimes? Will they alter the geopolitical balance of power, and change the nature of warfare? The goal of CS22a is to equip students with the intellectual tools, ethical foundation, and psychological framework to successfully navigate the coming age of intelligent machines.

        "description": "Issues of technology law and policy -- many involving Silicon Valley companies -- are among the most interesting and challenging in law today. Drawing on the lecturer's experience as General Counsel of Facebook, the course will focus on actual controversies that confront practicing lawyers as they grapple with these evolving issues in a fast-moving environment of innovation and disruption. In less than 15 years of existence (and less than seven years as a public company), Facebook has confronted an unending set of legal challenges, across the full range of subject matter, and in the process has helped define technology law in the 21st century. From questions of privacy law, to antitrust, to intellectual property law, to cutting-edge litigation, and most recently to election law and the political process, Facebook has been at the forefront of many of the defining legal developments of our era. In order to navigate these issues effectively, lawyers must combine legal expertise with practical business judgment as well as an understanding of the broader social and political context -- and in this course, students will develop those skills by studying Facebook legal controversies from the past and the present.  Grading will be based on attendance, class participation, and a short final paper.",

        "description": "Taught by a team of law and engineering faculty, this unique interdisciplinary course will empower students across the University to work together and exercise leadership on critically important debates at the intersection of law and digital technology.  Designed as an accessible survey, the course will equip students with two powerful bases of knowledge:  (i) a working technical grasp of key digital technologies (e.g., AI and machine learning, internet structure, encryption, blockchain); and (ii) basic fluency in the key legal frameworks implicated by each (e.g., privacy, cybersecurity, anti-discrimination, free speech, torts, procedural fairness).  Substantively, the course will be organized into modules focused on distinct law-tech intersections, including:  platform regulation, speech, and intermediary liability; algorithmic bias and civil rights; autonomous systems, safety, and tort liability; &quot;smart&quot; contracting; data privacy and consumer protection; &quot;legal tech,&quot; litigation, and access to justice; government use of AI; and encryption and criminal procedure.  Each module will be explored via a mix of technical and legal instruction, case study discussions, in-class practical exercises, and guest speakers from industry, government, academe, and civil society.  Law students will emerge from the course with a basic understanding of core digital technologies and related legal frameworks and a roadmap of curricular and career pathways one might follow to pursue each area further.  Students from elsewhere in the University, from engineering to business to the social sciences and beyond, will emerge with an enhanced capacity to critically assess the legal and policy implications of new digital technologies and the ways society can work to ensure those technologies serve the public good.  All students will learn to work together across disciplinary divides to solve technical, legal, and practical problems.  There are no course prerequisites, and no prior legal or technical training will be assumed.  Students will be responsible for short discussion papers or a final paper.  After the term begins, students electing the final paper option can transfer from section 1 to section 2, which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  This class is cross-listed in the University and undergraduates and graduates are eligible to take it.  Consent Application for Non-Law Students:  We will try to accommodate all students interested in the course.

        "title": "Data: Privacy, Property and Security",
        "description": "The collection, use and marketing of personal data are ubiquitous in the digital age.  This seminar will explore the diverse legal regimes regulating personal data--including privacy, property and security--and the imperfect nature of their protections.  Legal rules are rapidly evolving to address, if not resolve, the inevitable conflicts between privacy, property and security in relation to personal data.  Laws have been enacted and new ones are under consideration at the national, state and even municipal levels, as well as around the world.  Norms are emerging to guide these conflicts in the operation of business.  Technology is evolving that can facilitate the protection, or accelerate the exploitation, of personal data.  At the heart of all these developments is the question, who owns and controls personal data in the digital age.  The same piece of data may in different hands raise different expectations.  As an example, A may have a privacy expectation that her purchase from an online marketplace is no one's business but her own.  B, the app that served as intermediary between the buyer and seller, may have a property or contract expectation that it owns the metadata and other information about A's buying habits.  C, a government agency, may have a security interest in collecting or unearthing the details of A's purchase of particular items.  This same triad of interests is implicated across a wide variety of highly sensitive personal data, such as location information, facial recognition and medical results.  This seminar will explore these data rules, norms, technologies and conflicts through three sessions of lecture and interactive exercises addressed to privacy, property and security, respectively; four sessions devoted to presentations from leading representatives of consumer, corporate and government interests, with questioning by students in the class; and two sessions devoted to discussion of student answers to problem sets, focusing on an exploration of the privacy-property-security conflict and on forward-looking solutions to the protection of personal data.

This class will review the intermediary liability laws that shape platforms' decisions about online content, and examine how successfully those laws achieve their goals. Students will be encouraged to think pragmatically about the legal, operational, and product design choices platforms may make in response to particular laws, drawing on the instructor's experience handling such questions as Associate General Counsel at Google. Readings and discussions will focus primarily on current US law, with some attention to European laws and to proposed or pending legislation.  Important themes of the class include Constitutional and human rights constraints on intermediary liability laws; legal limits (or lack thereof) on platforms' enforcement of privatized speech rules under their Community Guidelines or Terms of Service; global enforcement of national laws requiring platforms to remove content; and connections between platform liability and other areas of law such as consumer protection or privacy.  Students will be responsible for three written assignments. The longest will be a final paper of 15 pages. The other two will both be short responses to the week's reading. Up to three students, with consent of instructor, will have the option to write an independent research paper for 3 units.  After the term begins, students (max 3) accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

Taught by a long-time cybersecurity practitioner, a recovering cyberlaw litigator, and a group of hearty, motivated TAs, each session will begin with a lecture covering the basics of an area of technology and how that technology has been misused in the past. Students will then complete a lab section, with the guidance of the instructor and assistants, where they attack a known insecure system using techniques and tools seen in the field. Each week, there will be a second lecture on the legal and policy impacts of the technologies and techniques we cover. By the end of the course, students are expected to have a basic understanding of some of the most common offensive techniques in use today as well as a comprehensive overview of the most important aspects of cyberpolicy and law. No computer science background is required. All students must have access to a Windows, Mac OS X or Linux laptop. Students must enroll in the lecture as well as one Computer Lab (Lab meets 50 minutes once a week).  Special Instructions:  This class is limited to 120 students with 30 spots for SLS students.

This class will review the laws that shape platforms' decisions about online content, with a primary focus on intermediary liability laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), Communications Decency Act Section 230 (CDA 230), and the EU's eCommerce Directive. The majority of course material will be from the U.S., but some will explore international models and in particular laws in the European Union. Some classes will explore the impact of related areas of law, including privacy law, and some will go beyond current legal models to explore forward-looking legislative and policy proposals.  Important themes of the class include Constitutional and human rights constraints on intermediary liability laws; legal limits (or lack thereof) on platforms' enforcement of privatized speech rules under their Community Guidelines or Terms of Service; global enforcement of national laws requiring platforms to remove content; and tensions between the goals of intermediary liability law and those of privacy, competition, and other legal frameworks. Students will be encouraged to think pragmatically about the legal, operational, and product design choices platforms may make in response to particular laws, drawing on the instructor's experience handling such questions as Associate General Counsel at Google.  Students will be responsible for (1) posting six reading response comments or questions to a class discussion board (these are due before class meets on six class days of your choice, they can be very brief and informal); (2) participating in class discussion, potentially including discussion of points raised in your written questions; and (3) completing a final examination.  The course is open to law students and students in the Masters in International Policy (MIP) program. Thirty-five students will be admitted, with an effort made to have 25 students from the law school admitted by lottery (LAW 4051) and 10 from MIP admitted by instructor consent.

        "title": "Governing Artificial Intelligence: Law, Policy, and Institutions",
        "description": "Even just a generation ago, interest in &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; (AI) was largely confined to academic computer science, philosophy, engineering, and science fiction.  Today the term is understood to encompass not only long-term efforts to simulate the general intelligence associated with humans, but also fast-evolving technologies (such as elaborate neural networks leveraging vast amounts of data) with the potential to reshape finance, transportation, health care, national security, advertising and social media, and other fields.  Taught by a sitting judge, a former EU Parliament member, and a law professor, and conceived to serve students with interest in law, business, public policy, design, and ethics, this interactive course surveys current and emerging legal and governance problems related to humanity's relationship to artificially-constructed intelligence.  To deepen students' understanding of legal and governance problems in this area, the course explores definitions and foundational concepts associated with AI, likely pathways of AI's evolution, different types of law and policy concerns raised by existing and future versions of AI, and the distinctive domestic and international political economies of AI governance.  We will consider discrete settings where regulation of AI is emerging as a challenge or topic of interest, among them:  autonomous vehicles, autonomous weapons, labor market decisions, AI in social media/communications platforms, judicial and governmental decision-making, and systemic AI safety problems; the growing body of legal doctrines and policies relevant to the development and control of AI such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act; the connection between governance of manufactured intelligence and related bodies of law, such as administrative law, torts, constitutional principles, civil rights, criminal justice, and international law; and new legal and governance arrangements that could affect the development and use of AI.  We will also cover topics associated with the design and development of AI as they relate to law and governance, such as measuring algorithmic bias and explainability of AI models.  Cross-cutting themes will include: how law and policy affect the way important societal decisions are justified; the balance of power and responsibility between humans and machines in different settings; the incorporation of multiple values into AI decision-making frameworks; the interplay of norms and formal law; technical complexities that may arise as society scales deployment of AI systems; AI's implications for transnational law and governance and geopolitics; and similarities and differences to other domains of human activity raising regulatory trade-offs and affected by technological change.  Note: The course is designed both for students who want a survey of the field and lack any technical knowledge, as well as students who want to gain tools and ideas to deepen their existing interest or technical background in the topic. Students with longer-term interest in or experience with the subject are welcome to do a more technically-oriented paper or project in connection with this class.  But technical knowledge or familiarity with AI is not a prerequisite, as various optional class sessions and readings as well as certain in-class material will help provide necessary background.  Requirements: The course involves a mix of lectures, practical exercises, and student-led discussion and presentations. Elements used in grading:  Requirements include attendance, participation in a student-led group presentation and a group-based practical exercise, two short 3-5 pp. response papers, and either an exam or research paper.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer, with consent of the instructor, from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement. CONSENT APPLICATION: We will try to accommodate as many people as possible with interest in the course.

        "description": "This course will examine contemporary challenges and trade-offs for tech law and policy decision-making presented by false information online. Topics will include content policy and regulatory responses to election misinformation; medical misinformation; the spread of misinformation in armed conflict and situations of widespread human rights violations; and conspiracy theories and rumors in the areas of science, climate, religion, and politics. Along with the faculty, guest speakers from academia and industry thought leaders will present on these topics, followed by a discussion. In addition, students will analyze real-world dilemmas confronting policymakers through practical case studies and will assume the role of a policymaker from either the private sector, the government, or a non-governmental organization as part of each class. Finally, this course will explore regulatory, policy, technological, and other solutions to enhance the integrity of the online information ecosystem and address the growing problem of false information online. Special Instructions: Up to five Law students, with the consent of the instructors, will have the option to write an independent research paper for Law School Research (R) credit. For students in this section (02), the research paper will replace the Final Policy Memo. All other elements used in grading will apply. Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2 or 3 units, depending on the paper length. Elements used in grading: Attendance, Class Participation, Written Assignments; Final Policy Memo or Final Research Paper.

        "description": "Last October, the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law released its long-awaited report &quot;Investigation of Competition in Digital Markets.&quot; Following a 16-month investigation into the state of online competition, the 450-page report analyzed the market power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple, and concluded that &quot;online platforms' dominance carries significant costs. It has diminished consumer choice, eroded innovation and entrepreneurship in the U.S. economy, weakened the vibrancy of the free and diverse press, and undermined Americans' privacy.&quot; The report included recommendations on restoring competition in the digital economy and strengthening antitrust laws and enforcement. The new Congress and the new Administration are expected to continue this work and advance proposals to reform the market.  This reading group will be devoted to an analysis of the state of online competition and potential remedies by studying the House report, as well as related actions and litigation. It will include deep dives into the specific allegations against Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple, potential remedies as to each, and other potential reforms to further competition in digital markets.  The reading group will meet every other week starting in week 1 (i.e., weeks 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9) on Thursdays from 5 PM to 7 PM. It does not require an antitrust background, just interest in gaining a deeper understanding of the issues. Grading (MP/R/F) will be based on attendance and class participation. Enrollment will be limited to 10 students, with consent of the instructor. To apply for this course, students should send a brief statement explaining their interest and relevant background, if any, to the instructor at tomrubin@stanford.edu.

        "description": "This course provides a rigorous, hands-on, practical overview of the essential skills you'll need in today's practice of global technology and commercial transactions as in-house counsel. Students will learn key terms in commercial, IP and technology transactions, the art of collaborative negotiations with opposing counsel, and the development of interpersonal soft skills to successfully advise and counsel internal stakeholders in product-focused technology companies.  Students will learn to draft, review and negotiate agreements such as (1) NDAs; (2) Product, Hardware and Manufacturing Supply Agreements; (3) Engineering Services, Design and Development Agreements; (4) Software License Agreements; and (5) Joint Development Agreements.  Additionally, students will consider issues that arise during the contract lifecycle, handling business disputes, transactional ethics, dealing with stress &amp; deal fatigue.  This course is different from the typical law one examining law firm practice because it is focused on a product and high technology practice, with a heavy emphasis on product development, identifying and understanding supply chain risks, and working effectively to advise and counsel engineers in an in-house technology environment.  The objective of this course is to equip students with the tools and skills you'll need to step successfully into legal positions from start-ups to top technology companies after law school.  This course is suitable for all students interested in working in a technology, product, business or corporate environment.  In this course, students approach law from an applied, negotiated, transactional perspective, with an emphasis on the lawyer's role in shaping complex commercial and IP technology transactions in today's technology-focused business environment.  We will also have a guest lecturers and panel discussions from key bay area technology companies (which in the past have included Tesla, Google, Apple, and Intel). Prerequisites: Intellectual Property is recommended but not required. No technical background is required. Elements used in grading: attendance, thorough preparation and participation in all negotiations, participation in debriefings through meaningful discussions, and final work product (e.g. execution-ready agreements).",

        "title": "Net Neutrality",
        "description": "An open and affordable internet is critical to our economy, democracy, and our country's promise of equal opportunity. After the pandemic, everyone agrees on that.  How we get there is the hard part. That's what the debate over net neutrality is all about. This class will examine the policy issues, legal frameworks, and key court decisions that shape this crucial debate.  At its heart, net neutrality is the idea that we, the people who use the Internet, should be able to decide what we do online. We get to choose what sites to visit, what apps to use, and what videos to watch. Companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T that we pay to get online don't get to influence our choices.  The policy and legal fights over net neutrality have been going on for nearly two decades, both in the U.S. and internationally. In 2015, the debate captured U.S. public attention, leading to strong FCC protections and oversight. But in 2017, the FCC eliminated all protections. That set off fights in Congress, the courts, and the states.  The FCC is now widely expected to restore net neutrality protections, and there's a strong chance that will happen during Winter quarter (which would be awesome timing). Through lectures, class discussions, and guest speakers, the class will introduce students to the key questions underlying the net neutrality debate so that they can become informed participants. Do we need net neutrality rules, and, if yes, what should they be? What are the options for addressing net neutrality at the FCC, in Congress, and by states? How do court decisions constrain states and the FCC? What effect will the Supreme Court's recent rulings and upcoming cases on the major questions doctrine and Chevron deference have on the FCC's ability to restore net neutrality protections or reclassify broadband as a telecom service?  Who should take this class: Anyone who uses the internet. Those interested in internet and technology law, net neutrality, communications law, and appellate litigation. Those interested in seeing admin law in action. Those looking to clerk in the D.C. Circuit.  There are no prerequisites for this class. The class is open to first-year law students and graduate students from other schools.

        "title": "Antitrust and the Challenges of Competition in Digital Markets",
        "description": "These are unprecedented times for antitrust concerns about the market power and conduct of big technology companies, in particular Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple. The companies face an onslaught of regulatory and judicial scrutiny around the world. In the United States, the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, and state attorneys general are all investigating possible anticompetitive practices and/or have filed major antitrust lawsuits. Congress is pursuing multiple investigations, and the House Judiciary Committee released an extensive report last October detailing harms resulting from the alleged dominance of &quot;online platforms.&quot; At least six bills have been introduced in Congress to expand or clarify the application of antitrust laws to &quot;Big Tech,&quot; and vocal advocates for antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech now occupy important positions in the DOJ, the FTC, and the White House. Elsewhere in the world, the European Commission is investigating and has filed charges, and China's State Administration for Market Regulation has increased its focus on these issues.  At the heart of these issues is the impact major tech platforms have on competition, competitors, the economy, our democracy, and on billions of consumers/users. Core to the consideration and resolution of these issues is the question of what role antitrust and competition law should play in addressing those impacts and whether current antitrust theory and enforcement practices are adequate for that role in the US and around the world.  This seminar will closely study the development of antitrust and competition law in the United States and Europe and its application to today's digital markets. After an overview of the fundamental laws and theories underlying antitrust law, we will briefly review the evolution of antitrust theory and enforcement over the last 40 years, from the Chicago School to current calls for a &quot;neo-Brandeisian&quot; reinvigoration of antitrust, and the significance of that evolution for how we answer today's most-pressing competition questions. We will consider the unique challenges faced by antitrust analysis in the technology sector through case studies of landmark enforcement actions brought against IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and others.  The heart of the seminar will be a close examination and assessment of the antitrust allegations raised in the present wave of investigations and lawsuits. Our analysis will include how antitrust in these contexts should properly evaluate relevant markets involving complex platform businesses, how it should assess market power, whether various acts by large tech companies are anticompetitive/predatory or have countervailing procompetitive justifications, how we should determine the nature and scope of any resulting anticompetitive harm, and what remedies might be appropriate and effective in the event violations of antitrust law have occurred. We will conclude with an analysis of whether there are currently gaps in existing antitrust law and/or theory and what if any changes are needed to better serve the underlying purposes of antitrust (as well as what those purposes are and should be). We will evaluate a variety of pending and potential recommendations for transforming antitrust to more fully address some of the complex issues raised by online platforms and digital markets.  Readings will include judicial opinions, litigation documents and evidence, congressional testimony and reports, and legal and economic scholarship. Guests with significant relevant expertise will join several of the classes. The seminar does not require an antitrust background, just an interest in gaining a deeper understanding of how antitrust and competition operate in the unique context of online digital markets. Grading will be based on a series of written reflections, class participation, and a final paper or equivalent written product. Enrollment is limited to 16 students, with consent of the instructors.

        "description": "This course covers all of the basics regarding marketing law and false advertising, a rapidly changing and expanding area of law that dovetails nicely with trademark and copyright law.  In this course, we will cover the basics of false advertising claims under the Lanham Act, and also cover enforcement at the state level and by the Federal Trade Commission.  We will also study how false advertising law overlaps with areas of privacy law, business torts, and constitutional law, among other areas; and pay close attention to how these areas of law map onto social media, the influencer economy, and the metaverse.  Open to students who has taken either intro to IP or trademark law.  Limited to 35 students.  Elements used in grading:  Class participation, paper assignment.  Class meets from 2:00 to 4:00 on Thursdays, Jan 12, Jan 19, Jan 26, Feb 2, and Feb 9.",

        "title": "China Law and Business",
        "description": "The growing tension between China and the rest of the world after the COVID-19 outbreak has made it more important than ever for businesses and their advisers to understand the legal framework in China and related compliance issues.  Given their need to survive the current economic crisis, which will likely last for some time, foreign businesses--however guarded they are--must keep a watchful eye and be ready to seize opportunities arising from an economy that is too big to give up.  Designed to prepare students for different opportunities that are likely to touch on China and its regulatory framework, this introductory course examines Chinese legal rules and principles in select business-related areas, including intellectual property, dispute resolution (e.g., arbitration and litigation), foreign investment law, antimonopoly law, environmental protection, and artificial intelligence.  Drawing on her 25 years of experience handling issues related to U.S.--China relations, politics, and legal reforms, the instructor will, wherever appropriate, conduct discussions that help shed light on the role of China in the new world order.  Through active class participation and analysis of legal and business cases, students will learn both the law on the books and the law in action, as well as strategies that Chinese and international businesses alike can use to overcome limitations in the Chinese legal system.  Leaders from the law and business communities will be invited to share their experiences and insights.  This course is particularly suitable for law students, MBA students, and students enrolled in the East Asian Studies Program.  Undergraduates who have permission from the instructor may also take this course.  A Stanford Non-Law Student Course Registration Form is available on the SLS Registrar's Office website.  Elements used in grading: class participation (20%), team project (40%), and extended take-home exam (40%).  For the team project component, students will work with another student enrolled in the class to produce an analysis of a judicial case or legislation in China and discuss, for example, the implications of the related Chinese legal principles for businesses and/or major differences between these principles and similar U.S. legal principles.  Quality team projects may have the opportunity to be included in the professional journal published by the China Guiding Cases Project (&quot;CGCP&quot;), which is led by Dr. Mei Gechlik, the instructor, and her global team of nearly 200 members.  Team projects selected for publication will receive editorial input from the CGCP.",

        "description": "The big question in comparative law today - and one that is of key importance to anyone interested in international law - is whether we are currently witnessing a convergence of national legal systems. This course examines this question, as well as the related problem of American exceptionalism, by exploring key aspects of contemporary Western European legal systems, as well as (to a lesser extent) Latin American ones. We will study a range of legal institutions and practices, including such topics as legal education, the role of judges and judging, constitutional courts and judicial review, criminal procedure and punishment, and the rise and regulation of consumer culture. In contrast to the traditional comparative law course, we will also devote substantial time to such pressing public-law questions as racial equality and affirmative action, gender equality and sexual harassment, and church-state relations. In lieu of the final exam, students may opt to write four response papers to the assigned readings (each 5 to 7 double-spaced pages long). After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), with consent of the instructor.

        "title": "International Criminal Law and Its Enforcement",
        "description": "The establishment of a global system of international justice reveals that the promises made during the Nuremberg era are not mere history. Over the past two decades, the international community has undertaken a considerable investment in enforcing international criminal law in conflict and post-conflict situations with the establishment of the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, East Timor, Cambodia, and Lebanon. In addition, new hybrid models and multilateral investigative institutions are in operation, attesting to the creativity of justice advocates. Meanwhile, national courts are increasingly exercising expanded forms of criminal jurisdiction over international and transnational crimes. The International Criminal Court (ICC) sits at the apex of this system, although it is plagued by challenges to its legitimacy, erratic state cooperation, and persistent perceptions of inefficacy and inefficiency. Moreover, the global commitment to international justice remains inconsistent as calls for criminal accountability for the situations in Sri Lanka, South Sudan, and Syria -- among others -- go unanswered. This course will introduce students to the law, institutions, and actors that constitute the system of international justice and to the political environment in which this system is situated. Readings will map the once and future international criminal law institutions, offer an elemental analysis of international crimes and forms of responsibility as they have evolved in international law, and focus on the challenges of pursuing criminal prosecutions for international crimes. Jurisprudence from the various international and domestic tribunals will be scrutinized with an emphasis on understanding the prosecution's burden, available defenses, and sources of proof. The course will also engage new and perennial debates about the suitability of using criminal justice mechanisms to respond to mass atrocity situations and consider alternatives from the domain of transitional justice. In addition to the substance of international criminal law, this course will also serve as an introduction to international legal reasoning, law-making, and institutional design. It will complement existing courses at the Law School covering comparative law, international organizations, international human rights, criminal law, and public international law.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer, with consent of the instructor, from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement.

        "title": "European Union Law",
        "description": "The U.S. and the European Union (which comprises 27 European states and 450 million people) have the largest bilateral trade relationship in the world. Over 50% of the world's GDP is generated on the Transatlantic Marketplace. U.S. companies rely on the EU market for more than half of their global foreign profits, and U.S. investment in the EU is currently three times greater than U.S. investment in the whole of Asia. In recent years, this has tremendously heightened the need for a sound understanding of the legal system of the EU, especially for business and technology lawyers. Responding to this need, this course will, first, examine the internationally unique legal system of the EU as such, as it is applicable to any field of substantive and procedural EU law. Thus, we will look at the legal nature and the different sources of EU law and its relationship with the national law of the EU Member States, including European human rights and fundamental rights protection standards. We will cover the relevant EU law enforcement actions including state liability issues for breach of EU law as well as the jurisdiction of both European Courts and relevant remedies in national courts. Secondly, we will explore the legal framework governing business activities in the EU, from the perspective of a business entity as an internationally operating actor in a European business environment. In this context, we will focus on the most essential fields of EU business law, i.e. (a) the four fundamental economic freedoms of the European Internal Market for goods, services, capital, and persons (enterprises, workforce, immigration), including the legal and economic implications of Brexit, (b) EU competition (antitrust) law, and (c) the new digital European Internal Market and EU data protection and privacy laws. Special attention will be given to the question how companies established outside the EU can efficiently use EU business law to pursue their interests in the EU. Additional study and research opportunities for students in EU law, building on this course, can be found on the SLS EU Law Initiatives website (https://law.stanford.edu/transatlantic-technology-law-forum/european-union-law-initiatives/). Special Instructions: After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer, with consent of the instructor, from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement. Grades for students enrolled in section (01) will be based on writing assignments. Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2 or 3 units, depending on the paper length. Elements used in grading: Writing assignments or research paper.",

        "description": "What legal problems arise when firms go global? Lawyers are increasingly asked to advise clients with global operations and to respond to multiple and sometimes inconsistent national laws.  Through a series of case studies, we put you in the driver's seat and ask you to consider the challenges of doing business around the world.  How should Twitter react to free speech limitations in Turkey?  How should Facebook respond when governments around the world regulate its use and collection of data?  What are the consequences for a US retailer if it expands in Europe? What rights and protections must it grant its employees?  How should Nike weigh the legal risk from factory fires in Bangladesh?  How should investors in China (or Ethiopia or North Korea) deal with the reality that they will lack basic legal protections that are common elsewhere?  We examine how multinational firms respond to variation in national laws and what tools they have at their disposal when considering deals, disputes, and regulation.

        "title": "International Business Negotiation",
        "description": "This course is structured around a quarter-long, simulated negotiation exercise which provides an in-depth study of the structuring and negotiating of an international business transaction. This class will be taught in counterpart with a class at Berkeley Law School. Students in this class will represent a U.S. pharmaceutical company, and the students in the class at Berkeley will represent an African agricultural production company. The two companies are interested in working together to exploit a new technology developed by the pharmaceutical company that uses the cassava produced by the African agricultural production company. The form of their collaboration could be a joint venture, a licensing agreement or a long term supply contract. The negotiations between the two classes will take place through written exchanges and through real-time negotiation which will be conducted both in-person and via videoconferences. The purpose of the course is to provide students with an opportunity (i) to experience the sequential development of a business transaction over an extended negotiation, (ii) to study the business and legal issues and strategies that impact the negotiation, (iii) to gain insight into the dynamics of negotiating and structuring international business transactions, (iv) to learn about the role that lawyers and law play in these negotiations, (v) to give students experience in drafting communications, and (vi) to provide negotiating experience in a context that replicates actual legal practice with an unfamiliar opposing party (here, the students at Berkeley). Students will also learn about the legal and business issues that may arise in joint ventures, supply agreements and licensing agreements. The thrust of this course is class participation and active involvement in the negotiations process. Students are expected to spend time outside of class, working in teams, to prepare the written exchanges, to prepare for the live negotiations (as well as online negotiations in a world where these will be increasingly the norm), and to prepare for class discussions. Class discussions will focus on the strategy for, and progress of, the negotiations; collective evaluation of the class's preparation for, and performance in, the negotiations; and the substantive legal, business and policy matters that impact on the negotiations. In addition to the regular Monday class, the class will meet on Saturday September 30 from 10:30 AM to 1:30 PM at Stanford Law School (necessitated by the late start for the Stanford quarter this year and the need to sync with the Berkeley class).  In addition, classes will meet for the live negotiations on four Saturday mornings at 10:30 AM (10/14, 10/21, 10/28 and 11/4) in the San Francisco office of DLA Piper (555 Mission Street; close to Montgomery St. BART station), and one Thursday evening (via Zoom) at 7:00 PM-10:00 PM (10/26). The four Saturday classes will end at 1:30 PM, except for 11/4 which will end at 2:30 PM. Due to the Thursday and Saturday classes, this class will conclude on November 6.

        "description": "This course provides a rigorous introduction to the law, theory and practice of international commercial arbitration. International commercial arbitration which has become the default means of settling international disputes and with clients increasingly involved in international business transactions and cross-border activity, is a rapidly growing practice area in law firms of every size. The practice is peripatetic, with many international arbitration lawyers basing themselves in law firms in New York, Washington D.C., Paris, Hong Kong, Singapore, and other major world commercial centers.  The course will deal with the internationalist elements of the subject matter, but also examine international commercial arbitration from an American perspective. Students can expect to review both foreign and US commentaries, statutes and case law. The course will comprise of five main topics: (1) an introduction to the field of international commercial arbitration; (2) the agreement to arbitrate; (3) the arbitrators; (4) the arbitration process; and (5) the arbitral award. The intent is to provide a strong academic understanding of the various theories and principles, but with a strong practical bent.

        "title": "International Conflict Resolution",
        "description": "This seminar examines the challenges of managing and resolving intractable political and violent intergroup and international conflicts. Employing an interdisciplinary approach drawing on social psychology, political science, game theory, and international law, the course identifies various strategic, psychological, and structural barriers that can impede the achievement of efficient solutions to conflicts. We will explore a conceptual framework for conflict management and resolution that draws not only on theoretical insights, but also builds on historical examples and practical experience in the realm of conflict resolution. This approach examines the need for the parties to conflicts to address the following questions in order to have prospects of creating peaceful relationships: (1) how can the parties to conflict develop a vision of a mutually bearable shared future; (2) how can parties develop trust in the enemy; (3) how can each side be persuaded, as part of a negotiated settlement, to accept losses that it will find very painful; and (4) how do we overcome the perceptions of injustice that each side are likely to have towards any compromise solution? We will consider both particular conflicts, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the South African transition to majority rule, as well as cross-cutting issues, such as the role international legal rules play in facilitating or impeding conflict resolution, the ways intragroup dynamics affect intergroup conflict resolution efforts, and the role of transitional justice mechanisms to address atrocities following civil wars. Special Instructions: Section 01: Grades will be based on class participation, written assignments, and a final exam. Section 02: Up to five students, with consent of the instructor, will have the option to write an independent research paper for Research (R) credit in lieu of some of the written assignments and final exam for Section 01. After the term begins, students (max 5) accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. This class is limited to 20 students, with an effort made to have students from SLS (12 students will be selected by lottery) and eight non-law students by consent of instructor.  This class is cross-listed with International Policy (INTLPOL 250) and Psychology (PSYCH 383).",

        "title": "International Human Rights",
        "description": "In part as a result of the rise of international human rights mechanisms in the twentieth century, conflicts over resources, privileges and power are now increasingly mediated through the lens of human rights, in terms of the protection of individual or group rights. Given that many of the most significant and complex national and international challenges today center on fundamental questions of human rights, understanding the legal regime that governs these rights is an important part of a comprehensive legal education.  This course serves as an introduction to the law, theory and practice of international human rights, together with the instruments, organizations and arrangements that affect their implementation and enforcement.  It will explore human rights as a philosophical and legal concept, and briefly probe differences between human rights, civil rights, and development frames. The course will then focus on the legal regime through which sovereign states have established human rights instruments and doctrine as part of positive international law, sometimes with binding domestic legal effects. We will review the foundations and history of international human rights law; the major international and regional human rights instruments and institutions; mechanisms and strategies of enforcement; and selected current issues in the field.  A limited number of students have the option to write a long research paper in lieu of the final exam with consent of instructor. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Class Participation, Exam or Research paper.  This course is cross-listed with Human Rights (HUMRTS 117) and International Policy (INTLPOL 355).

        "title": "International Criminal Justice",
        "description": "(Formerly Law 752) The establishment of a global system of international justice reveals that the promises made during the Nuremberg era are not mere history. Over the past decade, the international community has undertaken a considerable investment in enforcing international criminal law in conflict and post-conflict situations with the establishment of the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, East Timor, Cambodia, and Lebanon.  As these ad hoc institutions wind down, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has become fully functional, although it is plagued by challenges to its legitimacy, erratic state cooperation, and persistent perceptions of inefficacy and inefficiency.  Moreover, the global commitment to international justice remains inconsistent as calls for criminal accountability for the situations in Sri Lanka, South Sudan, and Syria---among others---go unanswered.  This intensive mini-course in the early September Term will introduce students to the law, institutions, and actors that constitute the system of international criminal justice and to the political environment in which it operates. The classroom component (offered at Stanford during the first week of the course) will undertake an elemental analysis of international crimes as they have evolved in international law and focus on the challenges of interpreting these norms in a criminal prosecution.  Jurisprudence from the various international tribunals will be scrutinized with an emphasis on understanding the prosecution's burden, available defenses, and sources of proof.  The course will culminate in a visit to The Hague in the second week of the course, during which time students will meet with principals from the tribunals, including prosecutors, judges, administrators, and members of the defense bar.  In addition to the substance of international criminal law, this course will also serve as an introduction to international legal reasoning, law-making, and institutional design. It will complement existing courses at the Law School covering comparative law, international organizations, international human rights, and public international law.  The course grade will be based on a series of short papers and active in-class engagement with the assigned materials.

We will begin by considering foundational questions about the nature of international law, such as: the origins of international law in the sovereign equality of states; the global governance challenges arising from the absence of assured mechanisms for the interpretation or enforcement of international law; the sources of international law (including treaties and customary international law); the subjects of international law; principles of state responsibility; and the bases upon which states may exercise jurisdiction. We will then examine the incorporation and operation of international law in the U.S. legal system. In the second half of the course, we will look at a series of contemporary international law topics and issues, including international dispute resolution, international human rights law, the law governing coercion and the use of armed force, the law of armed conflict, international environmental law, and international criminal law. Throughout, we will consider current issues and problems arising in the international arena, as well as whether and to what extent international law affects the behavior of states. This course provides a general grounding in public international law and a foundation for more advanced or specialized international law courses.

        "description": "This course is structured around a week-long, simulated negotiation exercise which provides an in-depth study of the structuring and negotiating of an international business transaction. This class will be taught in counterpart with a class at University of Vienna Law School. Students in this class will represent a U.S. pharmaceutical company, and the students in the class at Vienna will represent an African agricultural production company. The two companies are interested in working together to exploit a new technology developed by the pharmaceutical company that uses the cassava produced by the African agricultural production company. The form of their collaboration could be a joint venture, a licensing agreement or a long-term supply contract, or some combination. The negotiations between the two classes will take place through written exchanges and through real-time negotiation which will be conducted in-person. The purpose of the course is to provide students with an opportunity (i) to experience the sequential development of a business transaction over an extended negotiation, (ii) to study the business and legal issues and strategies that impact the negotiation, (iii) to gain insight into the professional and cultural dynamics of negotiating and structuring international business transactions, (iv) to learn about the role that lawyers and law play in these negotiations, (v) to give students experience in drafting communications, and (vi) to provide negotiating experience in a context that replicates actual legal practice with an unfamiliar opposing party. Students will also learn about the legal and business issues that may arise in joint ventures, supply agreements and licensing agreements. The thrust of this course is class participation and active involvement in the negotiations process. Students are expected to spend time outside of class, working in teams, to prepare for class discussions involving the written exchanges, as well as preparing for the live negotiations. Class discussions will focus on the strategy for, and progress of, the negotiations, as well as the substantive legal, business and policy matters that impact on the negotiations. The course will be limited by consent to eight (8) students. Prerequisites: A course in basic negotiations (e.g., Law 7821) or comparable prior experience is recommended. Elements used in grading: Class participation, written assignments and final paper. There will be two preparatory sessions at Stanford during February and March 2018. Students in the class will travel to Vienna on or before Saturday, March 24th. Class sessions will begin on Sunday afternoon, March 25, and continue all day Monday, March 26 through Wednesday, March 28th. [Cultural tour and closing dinner on Thursday, March 29th, and depart for USA on Friday, March 30th.]",

        "description": "With more than a billion people living on less than $2 a day, global poverty is one of the biggest challenges currently facing humanity. Even though those who suffer the most are located in the developing world, many of the policies, economic opportunities, and legal actions that offer the biggest potential for global poverty alleviation are made in the United States. This course will provide an introduction to the study of global poverty. What causes poverty? Why have some parts of the developing world done better at alleviating poverty than others? Can the world ever be free of poverty, as the World Bank's official motto suggests? How is the COVID pandemic affecting global poverty, and how should policymakers think about any potential tradeoffs? More generally, what can aspiring lawyers do to improve the condition of the world's impoverished? These are some of the questions this course is designed to address. This course is intended especially for future lawyers and policymakers who seek a deeper understanding of the developing world. After a brief overview that will familiarize students with the major concepts and empirical debates in poverty and development studies, we will examine a variety of 'causes' of poverty, from poor governance to lack of economic opportunity to the role of society. Since this course is just as much about what can be done, we shall also consider applied approaches to poverty alleviation. These types of interventions include political/legal reforms such as anti-corruption initiatives, 'rule of law' interventions, right to information programs, privatization, and community-driven development models; economic solutions such as cash transfers and microfinance; and technological approaches such as new methods for measuring policy impact and the application of new technologies for state identification and distribution programs. In addition to more typical scholarly readings, students will review poverty alleviation policy proposals and contracts made by various stakeholders (academics, NGOs, states, international bodies, etc.). Grading is based on participation, a presentation of research or a proposal, and, in consultation with the professor, a research paper. The research paper may be a group project (Section 01) graded MP/R/F or an individual in-depth research proposal either of which could be the basis for future field research (Section 02) graded H/P/R/F. Students approved for Section 01 or Section 02 may receive R credit.  Automatic grading penalty waived for research paper.  Cross-listed with International Policy Studies (INTLPOL 281).  This course is taught in conjunction with the India Field Study component (Law 5026). Students may enroll for this course alone or for both this course and Law 5026 with consent of the instructor (12 students will come to India).

        "description": "This course will consider significant sources of social conflict, efforts to achieve social justice and the relevance and impact of human rights norms and oversight mechanisms in Latin America in the 21st Century.  Led by Prof. James Cavallaro, the course will involve weekly sessions, each focusing on a particular topic.  Readings will provide the basis for short student reflection papers to be prepared in advance of each session. The class will generally involve an initial presentation, followed by seminar-style discussion.  Topics will include the human rights crisis facing Mexico, in particular, forced disappearances, summary executions and torture.  We will consider, for example, the forced disappearance of 43 students in September 2014 (Ayotzinapa) in at least one session.  The current political and human rights crisis facing Venezuela will be considered, likely by an expert guest speaker.  So too will the peace process in Colombia and the Special Jurisdiction for Peace.  Other sessions will consider social conflict and justice issues across the region.  These issues will include the resurgence of populism in the United States and Latin America and its effects on social justice and human rights, the continued relevance of the Organization of American States and its human rights bodies, migration and human rights, the rights of indigenous and traditional peoples and models of development, among others.  Elements used in grading:  Grades will be based on class participation, and either several short reflection papers (section 01) or a final paper (section 02).  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

        "description": "This course provides an in-depth introduction to the doctrine, practice and critiques of the Inter-American Human Rights System (&quot;IASHR&quot;). Students will examine the major instruments for human rights protections in the IASHR, the Inter-American Court and Commission's procedure and jurisprudence, as well as the obstacles and opportunities that civil society, victims, and advocates encounter when engaging the inter-American system.  The Course will consider issues of implementation, and the types of measures and forms of relief that can be sought from the Court and the Commission. The inter-American system has played a crucial role in opening spaces for debate on human rights protections in Latin America and the Caribbean, increasing protections at the domestic level, and supporting civil society in its quest for accountability for massive human rights violations.  The system has also played a role in civil society efforts to bring the human rights debate home, including in the United States.  Students will have an opportunity to cast a comparative look at the inter-American and the European Human Rights systems and to consider the comparative advantages, disadvantages and complementary potential of regional human rights systems and universal international human rights and criminal justice bodies.

Yet it is also a means by which political communities protect themselves, pursue collective interests, and defend their rights.  When, if ever, is the recourse to armed force justified, either as a legal or moral matter?  And what rules, if any, do law and morality impose on the conduct of war?  The course explores both the international law regime and the just war theory principles governing war.  We will begin by considering when states may permissibly use force, and how changing security threats, including terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the impulse to respond to widespread humanitarian atrocities challenge and are reshaping the legal framework on recourse to force.  We will then explore the rules governing the conduct of warfare itself, including the constraints on the means and methods of war, the requirement to avoid targeting non-combatants in armed conflict, and the rules governing the treatment of detainees.  A particular focus of the class will be the application of these rules in non-traditional, asymmetric conflicts between states and non-state armed groups.  Throughout, we will consider the relationship between just war theory and the international law regime governing the use of force, when they conform with one another and when they diverge, and why.

Jewish Law is the world's oldest complex legal systems with distinct and idiosyncratic approaches to family, commercial, ritual and many other areas of law.  It also has developed an elaborate &quot;conflicts of law&quot; sub-literature focusing on when should Jewish Law apply and when should some other legal system apply, reflecting the long history of the Jewish community in the diaspora as a minority.  In this course, we will consider how Jewish law approaches a number of specific topics and we will ponder as well the proper interaction between Jewish law and secular legal norms, Jewish Law and changes in technology, Jewish law and sovereignty, Jewish Law and Bioethics and Jewish law and Family.  Other topics will be added as we all see fit.  Students who are interested in making a presentation on an area of their choice are welcome to do so.

        "title": "Law, Lawyers, and Transformation in Democratic South Africa",
        "description": "South Africa's transition to democracy in 1994 marked the formal end of the comprehensive political, economic, and social system of racial subordination known as apartheid. The country has changed dramatically since then, as the government has built several million new housing units, created social welfare systems, and created an array of government and private sector programs to combat discrimination and redress the effects of subordination. Yet the country remains among the most unequal in the world, with 64% of black South Africans living below the poverty line, compared to 1% of whites. Most non-white South Africans receive poor education, live in substandard housing, and have limited employment opportunities.  ..............In recent years, discontent with the pace of economic and social transformation has boiled over. In 2015, university campuses erupted in protests. Students' demands quickly expanded from the removal of statutes of white colonizers to wider &quot;decolonization&quot; of university faculty and curricula and the expansion of access to higher education. &quot;Born-free&quot; student activists are now calling for faster, more radical transformation not just of campuses but of the society as a whole; many denounce what they see as the Mandela generation's overly conciliatory approach to white privilege in the economy, society, and interpersonal relations. Since 2018 there is new dynamism at the top, too: many South Africans believe that their new President, Cyril Ramaphosa, will curtail corruption and expand redistributive economic and social policies...............This course provides an opportunity to engage South Africa at this exciting historical moment, through intensive study during a week at Stanford and meetings with lawyers, activists, community members, and possibly students, journalists, and politicians during a week in Cape Town. We will focus on how lawyers are struggling for social justice and economic and social transformation--sometimes through ambitious arguments using South Africa's highly progressive constitution, but more often by supporting social movements day to day. Our learning will be grounded in specific cases, such as of the shack-dwellers movement Abahlali baseMjondolo; Equal Education, an organization of high school-age students; and pioneering class actions on behalf of injured gold miners. These cases will enable us to explore various ways law and lawyers fit into social change, the challenges and rewards of such work, and how their perspectives overlap with and diverge from those of their clients. At the same time, we will draw connections between this work and the grand debates and historical arc described above. While comparing South Africa with the United States will not be a primary purpose of the course, we may well see interesting parallels and divergences, and will have some space to discuss those, among ourselves and perhaps with our South African interlocutors...............The format of the course will be unusual: We will return to campus before the Fall quarter and spend the week of September 12 preparing intensively at Stanford. We will meet daily for approximately three hours of discussion, collaborative exercises, and some lecturing, as well as read assigned material outside class. We will (a) learn some essential background on apartheid; current legal, political, economic, and social conditions; and our case studies; (b) begin to analyze legal activism methods and the challenges of transformation; and (c) prepare topics and specific questions for our meetings in South Africa, which students will lead. The following weekend we will fly to Cape Town, where we will spend the week of September 19 learning from visits to organizations and communities, and possibly one or two museums or other sites, as well as from discussions with a range of South Africans. We will return the weekend before the Fall quarter begins...............Stanford Law School is committed to equal access to field study courses regardless of financial situation. The School covers nearly all expenses during the trip, but students must pay for their own transportation to and from South Africa. Students who qualify for financial aid can receive a supplemental award to cover those transportation costs...............The course grade will be based on a series of short papers (one or more of which may be due after our return), active in-class engagement with the assigned materials, and preparation for and participation in interviews during the trip, and.

This macro vision may hide the distinctive characteristics of each country, as Latin America is a patchwork of idiosyncrasies regarding corruption. However, Latin American countries are narrowing their differences to closer patterns at a considerable pace. Latin America is facing an unprecedented chapter in its history against corruption due to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and other international organizations' recommendations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the US federal law that addresses accounting transparency requirements for companies that negotiate bonds in the US), and other constraints related to economic globalization. This course will present students with the theoretical literature that aims to explain corruption in Latin America, the technical constraints that have recently reshaped its practices, and the latest most significant cases. From the petty bribery that is essential for people to gain access to basic needs, to the sophisticated structure that is the mainstay of organized crime, corruption embodies an enormous range of different practices. Risk and uncertainty, information asymmetry, and contract enforceability are traditional barriers to the development of ethical business in Latin America in general. However, recent episodes in Latin America have demonstrated that corruption involving politicians and public procurement concretizes huge entry barriers to the free market. One of the aims of this course is to show how this kind of corruption is incorporated within the design of legal statutes and the practices of institutions. Some of the questions raised by this course will address issues including the following: what companies and institutions can do to improve fair trading in Latin America and stop the vicious cycle of corruption; how successful they might be considering Latin America's social and political environment; what challenges are introduced by the Foreign Corruption Practices Act; how political austerity in Latin America relates to the ability to inspect areas that are vulnerable to corruption and criminality; what the recent plea-bargain cases in Latin America, especially Brazil, show about hands-on experience with corruption; and how this knowledge can prepare lawyers to prevent their clients from falling into the same path-dependent dangers. The course is designed for JD candidates and LLM students, but graduate students from other departments are most welcome. Legal jargon is not expected. We will learn through seminar-style discussions and lectures. Elements used in grading are class participation, attendance, and a few reaction papers.",

        "title": "Comparative Law and Society",
        "description": "This is a course about the relationship between law and the larger society--but with readings drawn almost entirely from studies carried out in countries other than the United States.  The course will look, for examples, at readings from Chile, China, England, Germany, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Venezuela.  Introduction:  The aim of the seminar is to introduce students to studies of the relationship between law and society, but with an international and comparative perspective.  The readings use a broad range of methods and techniques, to explore how legal rules, processes and institutions are framed by, and influence, the social context.  Paying attention to the social context opens the door to a richer understanding of the law, a better explanation of what makes it work (or not work) and how it changes over time.  Traditionally the field called comparative law has concentrated heavily on differences between common law and civil law; and at principles and doctrines and formal rules.  But in the real world we know that systems can behave every differently even if they share formal rules and institutions.  Consider, for example, Canada and Jamaica, both common law countries; or Japan, Haiti and Spain --all civil law countries.  In many ways, the world today is a global village.  Lawyers, too, often work across borders.  It is the theory of the course that we can learn a lot about law and legal institutions, if we look at experiences in different countries:  plea bargaining in England; how victims of motorcycle accidents in Changmai, Thailand, deal with tort law; how the black market for used cars functioned in the former East Germany; the controversy over honor killings in Jordan; disputes over the sale of tunas in Tokyo's fish market; informal lending markets in Taiwan.  The aim is a more general understanding of how legal systems work, how structure and culture interact; and the role of lawyers, judges, courts, and institutions in different societies.  There are lessons to be learned about American society as well.  Methodology and evaluation:  The discussions in the classes will focus on a selection of readings from Law in Many Societies --a reader edited by Lawrence Friedman, Rogelio P&eacute;rez-Perdomo and Manuel G&oacute;mez (Stanford University Press, 2011). Other readings are contained in a package available to students in the class.  Some of the readings are classics in the field.  Others raise contemporary problems.  The course is a traditional seminar, in the sense that everyone in the seminar will be encouraged to speak, and to contribute to general discussion.  For each class, each student must write a short essay, reflecting on the readings (two or so pages at most or about 500 words).  These should be sent to both professors (lmf@stanford.edu &amp; rperez3@law.stanford.edu) and to fellow students, by email, not later than 24 hours before the class.  These reflection papers allow participants to tell us what aspects of the readings they found significant, and what they found right or wrong about the readings.  No footnotes or research are expected, and are, in fact, discouraged.  The reflection papers are required; but they are not graded.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer, with consent of the instructor, from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement.  Automatic grading penalty waived for writers.  Elements used in grading:  The course grade will reflect class participation, and an extended take-home exam or a research paper at the end of the quarter.",

        "title": "Third World Approaches to International Law, Borders, and Migration",
        "description": "The mass movement of people across international borders is widely framed as among the most pressing challenges of the 21st Century. Globally, debates regarding immigration law and policy remain controversial political flashpoints. The purpose of this seminar is a critical examination of the international legal theory, doctrine, and practice of borders and migration, which are essential for making sense of national immigration regimes, and the contentious debates around them.  An emerging body of critical scholarship is challenging the fundamental assumptions that underlie the law and political theory of borders and international migration, and that does so by foregrounding the ways in which colonial, neocolonial and other forms of empire have shaped contemporary borders. This seminar will introduce students to this emerging body of scholarship and to the applicable international law. We will consider borders as sites of racial, political, and other forms of injustice. We will also consider some of the legal arguments that have been made for decolonial, reparatory, abolitionist, and other approaches to reimagining borders.  The seminar will introduce students to Third World Approaches to International Law--an approach to the study of international law that centers the mutually-constitutive relationship between European colonialism and foundational international legal doctrine. TWAIL examines international law as a (contested) historical and contemporary system of Third World subordination, and explores the possibilities of more just international legal futures. The seminar will also include Critical Race Theory analysis of borders and international migration.  Public international law is not a prerequisite course for this seminar. However, students who have not taken public international law will be encouraged to do some additional assigned background reading in order fully engage with the seminar's central themes. The course will be evaluated based on attendance, class participation, reading responses and a presentation. A limited number of students will have the option of writing a long research paper in lieu of the reading responses requirement.  After the term begins, a limited number of students enrolled in the course can transfer from section 01 (two units) into section 02 (three units), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.",

The past decade has been defined by democratic backsliding and the reemergence of authoritarianism around the globe. Freedom House marked 2021 as the 18th consecutive year of global democratic decline, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing polarization, and rising inequality. In the face of such trends, what role can a healthy, independent judiciary play in halting the rise of anti-democratic leaders and preserving the rule of law?  Students enrolled in this policy lab will have the opportunity to investigate answers to this question by conducting comparative research on 21st century judicial reform efforts. Which nations have pursued innovative new strategies to improve the functioning of their judiciaries? Topics for research will include advances in judicial independence, vetting, appointment mechanisms, balance of power structures, constitutional review, access to justice, and other factors affecting the rule of law. During spring break 2023, this course will be held in Bogota, Colombia and will consist of conversations with lawyers, judges, and NGOs who are active in judicial reform efforts. Students will also meet Justices of the Colombian Constitutional Court. Enrollment is limited to 14 students. PLEASE NOTE: Students will need a passport to travel to Colombia.

        "description": "This course will consider Ukraine's Herculean political-economic and legal/regulatory challenges managing social and economic cohesion during wartime while simultaneously preparing for a healthy and durable post-war reconstruction.  If you asked Ukrainians what is most important in this time of war, they may say that we need military assistance to win the war, we need to keep the economy afloat, and we need to make progress on EU accession in order to secure the future of the country.  With those demands in mind --setting aside the military component, in the first week at Stanford we will start by considering Ukraine's unique history and political economy -- and how that political economy has changed during the war -- drawing in potential guest lecturers from Stanford and Ukraine. Too often reform proposals do not take into account the history and political economy of the countries in which those reforms are proposed.  This course will endeavor to not repeat that mistake.  The course will then focus on support for key policies, institutions (such as the judiciary and anti-corruption bodies) and infrastructure (such as electricity, gas, rail, and communications infrastructure) that will drive Ukraine into its post-war reconstruction.  Finally, the course will consider the essential legal, regulatory and governance pathways Ukraine will need to follow -- from legal aspects of war damages for reconstruction, to anticorruption, to procurement and competition law, to judicial reform, to the EU accession process -- essential for a prosperous and safe post-war Ukraine in the heart of Europe. This part of the course will be supplemented with guest lecturers with direct experience in these areas, including, for example, Ukrainian government officials, private sector and civil society actors.  The first week of this course will be at Stanford and the second week will be in Warsaw.  Elements used in grading:  TBA.",

        "description": "The State-Building and the Rule of Law Seminar is centrally concerned with bridging theory and practice. The seminar introduces the key theories relevant to state-building generally, and strengthening the rule of law in particular. This course explores the multidisciplinary nature of development -- through readings, lectures, guest lectures, case studies, and seminar discussions --- and weighs how lawyers fit in and contribute to the process. The set of developing countries considered within the scope of this workshop is broad. It includes, among others, states engaged in post-conflict reconstruction, e.g., Cambodia, Timor Leste, Rwanda, Iraq, Sierra Leone; states still in conflict, e.g., Afghanistan, Somalia; the poorest states of the world that may not fall neatly into the categories of conflict or post-conflict, e.g., Nepal, Haiti; least developed states that are not marked by high levels of violent conflict at all, e.g., Bhutan; and more developed states at critical stages of transition, e.g., Tunisia, Georgia, Ukraine, Hungary. The course is updated to include current events affecting state-building processes, including COVID, the regression of the rule of law, and the emergence of China. Elements used in grading:  Grading is based on participation, a presentation of research or a proposal, and, in consultation with the instructors, a research paper.

        "title": "International Peace Negotiations",
        "description": "This intensive course taught by senior peace mediator Ameya Kilara will give students a unique window into the world of high-stakes international peace negotiations. It will help students look beyond the headlines on conflicts like Ukraine,Afghanistan and Kashmir and analyze them from a negotiation perspective. The course aims to provide students with a map of the terrain of international conflict resolution, build drafting and negotiation skills, and allow them to experience practice problem solving amidst the real-world challenges of this field.  Week 1 of the course will equip students with core negotiation skills, frameworks, and tools used by negotiators and mediators, and challenge students to engage with the messy interplay between law and politics in complex conflict situations.In addition to developing students' technical skills and knowledge of peace processes, the course will encourage reflection on how identity plays out in peace processes. In particular, it will critically examine the subjective positions of those intervening in conflict situations from the perspective of race, gender and Global North/South dynamics, with a view to cultivating interventions that center the voices and needs of those directly impacted by conflicts.  Week 2 of the course will be a deep dive into the Kashmir conflict, one of the world's oldest and most difficult negotiations involving three nuclear states: India, Pakistan and China. This will be an opportunity for students to apply concepts introduced in the first week, put themselves in the shoes of conflict parties and mediators, and practice problem- solving in the midst of uncertainty and complexity. Through a series of in-class exercises, students will draft and present a range of materials relevant to peace negotiations, including stakeholder maps, advisory briefs, policy memos and note verbales. As students engage in this problem-solving process, they will have the rare opportunity of engaging with and seeking guidance from guest lecturers who are leading experts, including top negotiators, former spy chiefs, and grassroots peace activists.  Teaching methodology:  This course will be highly participatory and designed to provide space for individual, peer to peer, and collective learning. The course will require students to proactively engage in the classroom as well as develop working relationships with each other through assignments and group exercises outside of the classroom. Students will be assigned to small cohorts that will work together throughout the course, which will be a chance for them to develop relationships with their peers. The course will be structured around a combination of lectures, discussions, case studies, group work, and simulations. Students will be expected to keep a close eye on news related to the themes of the class for the duration of the course and each class will begin with asking students to connect a current issue/topic with concepts from the course. During the course, students will practice drafting and presenting conflict analysis and stakeholder maps, note verbales, policy memos and advisory briefs: under time pressure and with imperfect information that will simulate to some degree the practical challenges of peace negotiations.  Who is this course for?  This course is an introductory course on international conflict resolution and does not require any prior experience or qualifications. Anyone with an interest in peace and conflict would be welcome to participate. The course is particularly relevant to students preparing for careers in foreign policy, international development, conflict resolution, mediation,human rights and transitional justice. The course would also be useful to lawyers who want to hone their negotiation skills and ability to work in complex international environments.

        "title": "Legal Studies Workshop",
        "description": "The Legal Studies Workshop is designed to support students working on a piece of legal scholarship with an eye to publication. The workshop will meet four times a quarter, and will be offered in most quarters.  Students may sign up for as many quarters they wish, and will receive one credit for each quarter they are enrolled. The bulk of time each session will be devoted to presentations of one or two student works-in-progress. Every student is expected to present her/his own work at least once over the quarters she/he is enrolled in the Workshop, and to provide constructive oral feedback on others' work. We will set aside some time during the quarter for informal discussion of research ideas that are in a very early stage.  We welcome students who are just starting to explore their interest in an academic career; if you have any questions about whether the course is suitable for you, please contact Prof. Bernadette Meyler (bmeyler@law.stanford.edu) and Prof. David Sklansky (sklansky@stanford.edu).  Attendance is mandatory, absent extenuating circumstances. There are no written requirements for the course, and no requirement that the work presented be original to the Workshop. Students may wish to use the Workshop as an opportunity to expand on seminar papers or pursue independent research projects for which they are getting separate credit through one of the research tracks (e.g., directed research, dissertation). Whether students are working on a new project or revising an old, the expectation is that students will develop their topics independently of the course. Students who would like to participate in the Workshop but feel they need help in developing a workable research topic should consult faculty members ahead of time. Elements used in grading: Class participation and attendance.

We will consider, among other topics, Formalist (Langdellian) Legal Science, Sociological Jurisprudence, American Legal Realism, the Legal Process School, Law and Moral Philosophy, Public Choice Theory, Law and Economics, Feminist Jurisprudence, Critical Race Theory, the Law and Society movement, and Empirical Legal Studies. The readings are drawn principally from primary materials---the important contemporary manifestos and critiques of the schools of thought studied, along with writings that involve their application to concrete legal problems or reveal their influence on others. Enrollment allowing, students may be asked to help co-teach some of the sessions. Contact Prof. Fried (bfried@stanford.edu) if you would like to look at a syllabus from prior years before deciding whether to enroll. Special Instructions: If any student would like to write a research paper in lieu of the reflection papers, he or she should consult the instructor before the start of the course. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) (Reflection papers option) into section (02) (Final paper option) with consent of the instructor. Section (02) meets the R requirement.  Note:  Students enrolled in Section 01 will complete reflection papers (2-3 pages) for 9 of the 18 classes and students enrolled in Section 02 will complete a research paper (25-30 pages) on topic of student's choice related to the material of the course. Students are required to meet regularly with Prof. Fried throughout the Quarter to discuss progress on the paper.

        "title": "Animal Law",
        "description": "This course presents a survey of the historical and current status of this rapidly developing specialty. In brief, animal law encompasses all areas of the law in which the nature -- legal, social or biological -- of nonhuman animals is an important factor. It is an objective and logical specialization of a challenging area -- one with a growing number of cases and laws, increasing public and practical interest, and significantly different historical, legal and philosophical foundations than most other courses. Topics covered include animal cruelty, animals as property, tort claims regarding animals, legal issues involving farm animals and animals in entertainment, and federal statutes regarding certain groups of animals. The Animal Law course has been described as intellectually stimulating and ethically challenging, and synthesizes a wide range of legal concepts, and the course materials apply traditional ideas to legal concepts associated with animals in new ways. Students have called it a great bar review class, because concepts from many areas of law are covered with respect to their application to animals and their interests. More and more firms, large and small, are providing pro bono (and paying) work in the animal law area, as the field gains momentum and reputability in the legal community. Mr. Wagman is a lawyer in San Francisco, with a full-time animal law practice, representing organizations and individuals in a wide range of cases. He is one of the authors of the Animal Law casebook, two other animal legal texts, and has been practicing animal law for most of his 30-year career. His practice includes litigation, consultation, legislative work, and extensive writing and lecturing on various animal law topics. The class includes regular updates on his current cases, which for this semester includes a case that will be argued in the U.S. Supreme Court in the October 2022 term. He also regularly provides real-life experiences from the front lines of the field. Special Instructions: Students have the option to write an independent research paper in lieu of the final exam with consent of instructor. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

Our subject is thus a set of philosophical concepts, particularly legal positivism and natural law, but the approach is not purely conceptual. Rather, we will examine both the philosophical concepts in the abstract and how those philosophical concepts are reflected or actualized in the craft of legal argumentation, in the intellectual history of law, and in contemporary questions of politics and government. Above all, we will ask which conception of law best contributes to legal justice. The course consists in three units. Unit I is about theories of the nature of law, focusing on legal positivism and natural law. Unit II is about theories of particular departments of law, focusing on tort law and criminal law. Unit III takes a philosophical perspective on being a lawyer, focusing on questions of what principles define lawyers' role in society and what ideals give the life of a lawyer meaning. Grading is based on class participation, two in-class moot court presentations, and, based on individual student preference, either a final exam (a one-day take-home essay with a word limit) or a final research paper. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

        "title": "Is there an American Legal Canon?",
        "description": "Is there a &quot;canon&quot; of American legal scholarship? And if so, how does it shape our understanding of, or the way we talk about, the law today? In many other academic disciplines, a central element of any course of advanced study is an encounter with a &quot;canon&quot; of some sort. This is a core set of texts that are perceived as foundational, and that are commonly used as reference points for scholarly advances. In other disciplines, the canon can be an object of emulation or criticism. Indeed, the very idea of a &quot;canon&quot; of legal scholarly is often subject to contestation, e.g., given the barriers women and minority scholars have faced.  Drawing on the model of those foundational courses in other disciplines, this seminar aims to provide students with a working knowledge of a set of scholarly writings that can plausibly be characterized as an American &quot;canon.&quot; At the same time, the seminar aims to elicit from students a critical engagement with this putative &quot;canon.&quot; Particular attention is paid to the manner in which the canon either includes or marginalizes certain voices. Hence, one part of the seminar involves reading material that might be part of an expanded, more diversely populated canon.  The seminar is designed for two kinds of student. First, it is a useful course of study for students either interested in academia or those thinking about whether academia might be the right path for them (and indeed, the seminar is modeled on a course at Chicago designed for prospective academics, or those considering that path).  Second, the course is a chance to take a deeper dive into ideas that lurk behind many first-course private-law and public-law courses.  During the seminar, students will read and discuss a range of texts, many drawn from Fisher and Kennedy's The Canon of American Legal Thought. Students will be asked to write response papers and to lead discussion on certain readings. The precise set-up of the course will depend, however, on enrollment. Finally, students will also have the option of doing a longer paper for additional credit (section 02).  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section 01 (2 units) into section 02 (3 units) with consent of the instructor.  Elements used in grading: class participation, short papers, and optional final research paper. Paper extensions will be granted with instructor permission.

        "description": "When you have finished law school, you will (hopefully) have mastered a good deal of legal doctrine (many of you will review and/or sharpen your mastery of particular rules when you study for the Bar) and mastered a number of skills you will need to fulfill professional roles. (Hopefully, you will learn particular advocacy skills if you will be an advocate; writing skills that will help you whether you draft contracts or legislation, briefs or executive summaries, client letters; and, particularly in the Experiential Learning courses,  skills that will help you exercise prudent judgment, collaborate with others, work both efficaciously and empathetically in a diverse world.).  The claim that underlies this course is that your &quot;classroom&quot; courses here at SLS -- and at pretty much any of the academically ambitious schools that most of you considered attending -- had both a text (the doctrines and policies in the particular subject area that you were studying) and a &quot;sub-text&quot; (the concepts and themes that recurred across a wide range, maybe all, of your courses.) The goal of this course is to highlight these recurring themes (and remind you or illuminate for you just how often you confronted or will confront these issues), to discuss more overtly and directly the distinct approaches to each of these recurring issues than you might have discussed them before, and to expose you to some ways of approaching these issues that might be less familiar to you. In discussing these issues, we will draw on the insights offered by a wide array of &quot;schools&quot; of legal thought, including, but not limited to, libertarianism, Law and Economics, Legal Realism, Critical Legal Studies, Critical Race Theory, a variety of Feminist Legal Theories (anti-subordination feminism, &quot;cultural&quot; feminism), Langdellian Formalism and neo-Formalism, Law and Society.  So, for instance, we will discuss some or all of the following issues: 1. Ways in which legal pronouncements are framed (the tension between the use of rules and standards; between default and mandatory rules); 2. Remedial options and remedial mechanisms (the choice between inalienable entitlements, injunctions, damages, restitution, and distinct forms of punishment; between sliding remedial scales and binary outcome-determinative rules; conduct regulation and output/outcome goals; public enforcement v. mixed public/private enforcement v. private enforcement with differing degrees of collectivization of individual complaints); 3. Issues in the interpretation of both private and public legal texts (textualism, intent-based originalism, flexible purposivism) and distinct theories of why or in what ways texts may be either incomplete or &quot;dated,&quot; with some special attention to how to interpret texts that appear to delegate authority (to another decision maker, to a future decision maker) to make narrow, concrete decisions; 4. The interplay between substance and procedure (and its relationship to creating a gap between the law on the books and the law in action; the degree to which substantive rules are framed in the way that they are because rule makers are anticipating procedural barriers to enforcing alternative rules); 5. Institutional competence issues; 6. Alternative visions of human behavior and motivation (individualistic rational choice models with &quot;thin,&quot; generally materialistic goals v. thicker rational choice models v. individualistic models influenced by psychologists, advancing richer views of how people process information and form tastes and/or sociological models, focused more on group influence, group maintenance and group conflict); 7. Some recurring substantive issues (how we define operative assent and how we define normatively meaningful consent; how we deal with problems of incommensurable values or deny the possibility of incommensurability; when we do or don't believe people are adequately empowered by &quot;exit&quot; -- finding another provider in a market or subjecting ourselves to a different political body that will make the rules that govern us -- and when we believe power must be exercised politically/collectively; when we believe principal/agent problems are serious and how we think they are &quot;solved&quot;; battles between anti-classification and anti-subordination views of antidiscrimination norms) and 8. The origins of law and the impact of law (is law significantly autonomous or responsive to other social forces (where &quot;social forces&quot; might or might not be understood in significant part in terms of distinctions in power by race, class, gender, LGBTQ status etc.) and to the ideological predispositions of those who articulate it? Is law -- and most particularly the judge-made law we (over?) emphasize in law school -- effectual in achieving social change?)

Specifically, in this course, we will study who personal injury lawyers are, how they find clients, how they fund litigation, and how they usher complex cases to conclusion. In so doing, we will address: the role and regulation of lawyers; the use and abuse of the contingency fee; the legality and normative consequences of solicitation and attorney advertising; the propriety of secret settlements, NDAs, and expansive protective orders; the rise and impact of &quot;alternative litigation finance&quot;; and the vexing issues posed by class actions, aggregate actions, consolidated actions, and multidistrict litigations (MDLs). The final segment of the course will involve a series of case studies, where students will test their knowledge of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct and have the opportunity to see the course's themes echoed and expressed in recent real-world controversies. Importantly, though the course is nominally focused on &quot;the plaintiffs' lawyer,&quot; it does not just equip students to practice on one side of the &quot;v.&quot; Rather, through our grounded and contextualized study of legal ethics, advanced civil procedure, the legal profession, and contemporary legal practice, students will acquire tools to litigate cases of all stripes and for both sides.

Foundations of the law firm model such as bespoke client services, &amp;quot;billable&amp;quot; hours, large staffs (e.g., paralegals and secretaries), high associate-to-partner ratios and summer associate programs are becoming (or have already become) relics of a bygone era. Sophisticated clients today are utilizing a wide range of internal and external service providers and technologies such as artificial intelligence for their legal work. This diversity in the delivery of legal services is dramatically altering the supply and demand characteristics of the legal economy and markets. The breadth of available technologies and options is altering the types of skills and prerequisites required for attorneys to be successful private practice. The course is composed of two parts. In part one, the course focuses on the technological, economic and business practices transforming the legal profession are identified and their impact on the traditional approaches to law will be examined. In part two, the course focuses on how individual lawyers can adapt to or embrace the forces transforming law to improve their practice and succeed in the new environment. Part two of the course will also examine how the changing legal environment creates new ethical and professional challenges for attorneys.

        "title": "Legal Profession Workshop: The Future of Big Law",
        "description": "Ever since the global financial crisis, legal media have focused on the contraction of the corporate legal services sector. But today, partners at the top tier of big corporate law firms -- &quot;big law&quot; -- are earning huge profits and job prospects for graduates of top law schools interested in the corporate sector are bright. Although some commentators continue to predict that demand for corporate legal services will contract in the mid- to long-term, it seems more likely that demand for high-end legal analysis will persist if not increase in the foreseeable future. The question is who (or what) is going to perform that work, in what organizational setting, with what technological assistance, and in what part of the world. This seminar will address the key dimensions of change in the &quot;big law&quot; market and how changes in the delivery of corporate legal services may affect legal careers, gender equality, diversity, and work-life balance. Topics include the increased power of Fortune 100 General Counsel, new organizational models for delivering corporate legal services, the response of large law firms to new market factors, the expanding role of information technology in the delivery of corporate legal services, third-party litigation financing, changing legal markets outside the US, the evolution of global law firms, the effects of changes in law firm organization on women and lawyers of color, and the effects of changes in the legal market on legal careers. Course materials will include books and journal articles, media reports, blog posts and guest lectures.  Special Instructions: You may write a series of short reaction papers on 4 of the topics we will cover at the seminar sessions. Students electing this option will be graded on a Mandatory Pass/Restricted Credit/Fail basis and receive 2 units of credit. Alternatively, you may write a single research paper on a topic of your choice related to the evolution and future of Big Law.  This will satisfy the Law School's Research requirement. These papers will be graded on an Honors/Pass/Restricted Credit/Fail basis. Students taking the seminar for R credit can take the seminar for either 2 or 3 units of credit (section 02), depending on the project. After the term begins, students registered in the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

        "title": "Reforming the Profession:  Opportunities and Challenges Facing Tomorrow's Lawyers",
        "description": "Today's law students are tomorrow's lawyers, and tomorrow's lawyers face a set of fundamental challenges that are likely to reshape the profession in the years ahead. Clients are increasingly dissatisfied with large law firms, and many other people in need of services--like individuals of modest means and small businesses--are unable to access legal assistance altogether. At the same time, government and public interest lawyers continue to be asked to do more with less. These challenges existed in 2019, but the last few years have sharpened them. In particular, the Covid-19 crisis has forced a change in the way lawyers work, with greater use of technology, and the resurgence of the #BlackLivesMatter movement following the death of George Floyd highlights the lack of diversity in the profession. These developments add to existing pressures facing lawyers.  Leaders in law are just beginning to grapple with these challenges, and they're looking for help from the next generation. This course is designed for students who want to start their legal careers with a leg up on what success as a lawyer will look like in 5-10 years and beyond, and students who want to make positive change in the profession.  The specific topics covered will include: challenges to the law-firm model; the growth of in-house counsel; professional development and well-being as a lawyer; how technology is changing the practice of law; new models for delivering legal services; and the challenges of diversity and inclusion in the profession. The course is a mix of full-class discussion with the instructors and guest speakers from practice, small-group discussion of case studies, and work on projects. A significant part of most classes will involve case studies where students will put themselves in the role of lawyers, and talk through options for dealing with the issues presented. The instructors and guest speakers will introduce context about the challenges, and then engage students in thinking about possible paths forward.  Elements used in grading: The requirements will include attendance and participation, and either a final memo and presentation (section 01) or a research paper (section 02).  Memo writers will have to write a few short responses to the case studies as well.  There is no exam.  A maximum of 10 students will be permitted to write the research paper for R credit. All students interested in R credit should pre-register by lottery for Law 6016-0-02. Students who do not receive a spot in section 02 may enroll in section 01.",

        "title": "Access to Justice",
        "description": "The American civil justice system sits at a crossroads.  In three-quarters of the 20 million civil cases filed in state courts each year, at least one side lacks a lawyer.  Beneath those cases sit tens of millions more legal problems that never make it to court.  Many are significant, even life-altering moments: debt disputes, evictions, domestic violence, a former partner behind on child support, an employer refusing to pay overtime, or an insurer who denies a legitimate claim. Yet most people face these problems without legal assistance, or they &quot;lump it&quot; rather than navigate a complex system alone.  Such large, systemic gaps in access to legal services limit who can vindicate their rights, magnifying disparities based on income, education, race, gender, and ethnicity.  They are unfair and undemocratic.  The future of the civil justice system, and the legitimacy of the courts at its center, will turn on how --- and how well --- judges, court administrators, the legal profession, and an array of policymakers respond to these realities.  This course offers a wide survey of the current state of access to justice in the United States.  Students will consider the long-run causes and consequences of the justice gap and the major features, constituencies, and stakeholders of the state court systems that are struggling to close that gap.  Students will also tour and assess potential solutions --- from procedural simplification, to revived Due Process, to new technologies (e.g., online dispute resolution), to efforts to prime the supply of legal help by expanding non-lawyer practice of both the human and software sort.  Students will emerge with a synoptic understanding of one of the most pressing challenges to the legitimacy of the American legal system, along with new ideas about how to chart a career devoted to access to justice.  Student assessment is based on class participation, response papers, and a final project or paper.  Students writing a final paper may receive 2 or 3 credits depending on paper length.  After the term begins, students enrolled in the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructors.",

        "description": "Federal agencies make an astounding number of policy decisions, engaging in more &quot;lawmaking&quot; and &quot;adjudication&quot; than Congress and the federal courts, respectively. These policy decisions range from the seemingly trivial, such as how many cherries are needed for frozen cherry pie, to matters of life-and-death importance, such as how to limit emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. These agencies also range in age, organization, and duties. There is the postal service, which was created by the Continental Congress, and changed about five decades ago from a cabinet-level department to a government corporation, with current calls to privatize it. On the newer side, there is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was established in 2011 to protect consumers in the financial arena; its leadership and funding elements produced constitutional challenges that recently resulted in the Supreme Court invalidating its leadership structure (and agreeing to hear a challenge on its funding this coming year). In this quarter of Administrative Law, we will consider the creation and control of the modern administrative state. Topics will include the structure of administrative agencies and their place in a governing scheme of separated but overlapping powers; delegation of authority to agencies; types and requirements of agency decisionmaking; availability and scope of judicial review of agency action (and inaction); and other forms of agency oversight. We will apply concepts through many recent examples. A variety of policy areas will be considered, including (among others) the COVID-19 pandemic, national security, financial regulation, health care, the environment, food and drugs, and telecommunications.

        "description": "(Formerly Law 563)  Over the past century, tort law has been under sustained attack. Using a broad mix of case law, case studies, and scholarly analysis, this seminar will interrogate those attacks-including their historical roots, their theoretical justifications, and their practical effects. We will first study &quot;replacement reforms&quot;-attempts to jettison the common law in favor of alternative compensation mechanisms, including workers' compensation, auto no-fault, the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, and the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, housed within the U.S. Court of Claims. Second, we will study modern tort reform initiatives, often dubbed &quot;discouragement reforms,&quot; which have chiseled away at damages and chilled personal injury victims' incentives and capacity to seek relief. Finally, we will study the United States Supreme Court's own tort reform activity, including recent jurisprudence limiting punitive damages, preferencing arbitration, and granting broad preemptive effect to agency actions. Through this analysis, students will develop a deeper and richer understanding of the tort system, its contemporary operation and excesses, and the uneasy but undeniably important place tort law-and civil litigation more generally-occupies in contemporary American society. Special Instructions: Grades will be based on class attendance, class participation, and either several short reflection papers (section (01)) or an independent research paper (section (02)).

        "title": "Direct Democracy",
        "description": "In recent years, the use of ballot measures has sharply risen, and initiatives and referenda have featured prominently in contested debates over immigration, affirmative action, abortion, same sex marriage and term limits. In the wake of the Dobbs decision on abortion, controversies about ballot measures have become especially salient in many states. This seminar will focus on direct democracy as a method of lawmaking. Our principal focus will be on initiatives and referenda, but we will allocate some time to the recall, as well. We will consider the history, practice, theoretical justifications, and constitutional dimensions of direct democracy, as well as how direct democracy interacts with representative democracy. We will also explore many legal questions that have arisen as ballot measures have been used as instruments of governance and policy. Topics will include whether direct democracy comports with the federal constitution; judicial review and interpretation of ballot measures; minority rights under direct democracy; election rules relating to signature gathering, qualifying ballot measures and campaign finance; attempts to make it more difficult for voters to qualify and pass ballot measures; and the role of interest groups. Each student will briefly present on one particular ballot measure that is linked to that week's topics. Students will write either multiple response papers or a final research paper (for R credit) on a topic to be worked out with the instructor. Special Instructions: After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Students taking the seminar for R credit can take the seminar for either 2 or 3 units, depending on the paper length.

We will also consider the real world consequences that flow from different legal outcomes. There is no casebook. Instead, weekly readings will consist of judicial decisions, statutory and regulatory texts, and published articles (both academic and popular).

Rather than then going through section 1 of the amendment clause by clause (citizenship, privileges and immunities, due process, and equal protection) and then skipping to section 5 and Congressional power--we will briefly discuss the seldom mentioned sections 2 and 3, but don't worry, we won't spend a minute on the public debt provisions of section 4!--the course will then explore the amendment's doctrinal evolution with respect to several broad areas of American life, ranging from education to democracy to the economy to criminal justice to intimate relationships (not necessarily in that order). Obviously, we can't cover every area that the amendment touches. But the idea is to give you the tools to work with the changing doctrine and to be an intelligent critic of where we started and where we are.

        "description": "The Fourteenth Amendment is the source of many of the rights that have been cherished by many people throughout our nation.  Rights pertaining to sex and reproduction, marriage, parenthood, abortion, birth control, educational opportunity, sex discrimination, race discrimination and many more all are rooted in the 14th Amendment. In recent years, the Supreme Court has reshaped significant aspects of 14th Amendment doctrine, and accorded ever more importance to historical understandings in interpreting and applying the Constitution to contemporary society. Recent decisions have prompted considerable controversy and highlight enduring questions about the relation (or distinction) between law and politics in constitutional interpretation.  This course will examine the development of 14th Amendment doctrine, with special attention paid to equal protection and substantive due process. We will examine many contested constitutional questions, including same sex marriage and gender identity, race-based affirmative action in school admissions, and abortion and birth control, among many other topics. These constitutional controversies, in turn, raise broad questions about the meaning of citizenship, freedom, and equality, the very concerns that prompted the adoption of the 14th Amendment.  Readings will include judicial opinions and some scholarly commentary.  In this polarized time, it is important to note that the professor will not privilege any particular view of how the relevant controversies should be resolved. Indeed, our focus will be more on the processes and principles of constitutional decision-making than the outcomes reached by the Court. Students should be prepared to articulate and engage empathetically with arguments and perspectives that are different from their own. Class discussion will be supplemented with group exercises of various sorts. Elements used in grading: Class participation and written exam.",

While teaching legal doctrine, the course also considers practical and strategic questions in civil rights suits as well as theoretical and historical debates concerning the value and role of such litigation.  We address substantive topics including police uses of force and various constitutional rights, but the focus is on the law related to bringing and defending against such lawsuits, rather than substantive law.  This course complements other offerings such as Constitutional Law, Federal Courts, Advanced Civil Procedure, and Social Justice Impact Litigation.

        "description": "The guiding question of this course will be how we should think about the role of the U.S. Constitution in American law and American life. In considering this issue, we will address debates about constitutional interpretation (including both originalism and living constitutionalism), the nature and features of constitutional change within the American context, the role of federalism and the separation of powers in the constitutional scheme, and the nature of American constitutionalism as opposed to English and continental European models. We will tackle these debates in the context of some specific contemporary controversies about the Constitution, including: How do the civil rights movement and other social movements impact our understanding of the Constitution?; Does the Constitution reject a European-style inquisitorial process in favor of an Anglo-American vision of due process?; How important is consensus within the Supreme Court to establishing the legitimacy of constitutional meanings?; Why do we have nine Supreme Court justices, and; What is the Constitution, and how much does it include outside of the written document? Throughout we will be contemplating the extent to which our interpretation of the constitution depends on our vision of American democracy and the good society. Requirements for the course include regular class participation and either four response papers or a substantial research paper; students who take the research paper option will receive two or three units and 'R' credit. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  Automatic grading penalty waived for R-credit papers.  Special Instructions:  This class is limited to 16 students by lottery.  If applicable, openings will be filled from the waitlist in waitlist order.  Four additional spots may be reserved for 2Ls at the discretion of the instructor.  If determined by the instructor, four 2Ls will be admitted from the waitlist in waitlist order.  Elements used in grading: Attendance, Class Participation; Response Papers or Final Paper.

        "description": "Developed in the 1970s and 1980s, and for decades relevant only to law professors and activists, Critical Race Theory has recently become an object of criticism and controversy far beyond the legal academy. Some of the tenets of Critical Race Theory have made their way into other fields, including sociology, education, and cultural studies. Jurisdictions throughout the United States have passed laws banning the teaching of Critical Race Theory.  This class will examine the questions that are at the heart of current CRT controversies: What is critical race theory? Where did it come from? How does it illuminate and help counter the racism that has long plagued American society? Just as critical race theory constitutes a critique of American law and institutions, so too will the course take a critical perspective toward CRT, identifying both virtues and vices of the CRT project. The analysis of CRT, in turn, raises broad questions about  the role of race and racism in American society and its intersection with law reform efforts.  The readings will be varied. They will include law review articles and judicial opinions, and also articles drawn from the popular media.  Special Instructions: Grades will be based on attendance, class participation and (1) a short research paper or (2) a long research paper with consent of the instructor.

        "description": "This course will consider one of the newest intellectual currents within American Legal Theory -- Critical Race Theory. Emerging during the 1980s, critical race scholars made many controversial claims about law and legal education -- among them that race and racial inequality suffused American law and society, that structural racial subordination remained endemic, and that both liberal and critical legal theories marginalized the voices of racial minorities. Course readings will be taken from both classic works of Critical Race Theory and newer interventions in the field, as well as scholarship criticizing or otherwise engaging with Critical Race Theory from outside or at the margins of the field. Meeting dates:  The class will meet 7:15PM to 9:15PM on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday (January 7, 8, and 9), and the following Monday and Tuesday (January 13 and 14).

Major topics are the principle of representation, the extent and enumeration of national powers, the construction of the executive and judicial branches, and slavery.  Next come the ratification debates, including readings from antifederalist writers, The Federalist, and speeches in ratification conventions. We conclude with the addition of the Bill of Rights.

Covered topics include sexual and racial harassment, sexual orientation discrimination, and affirmative interventions aimed at increasing the minority group and/or female representation in certain job categories or segments of the labor market. In addition to surveying the doctrine as it stands and as it has developed over time, we will also explore the doctrinal and conceptual difficulties inherent in identifying invidious discrimination and in devising appropriate remedies.  The elements used in grading will be class participation, and, at the student's option, either a series of reflection papers or a single final paper on a topic to be determined in consultation with Professor Ford.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer, with consent of the instructor, from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement.  If more than 35 students wish to enroll, students should contact instructor to be placed on a waitlist.  Instructor will determine final enrollment.",

        "description": "The objective of the course is to explore the increasing ethical challenges in a world in which technology, global risks, and societal developments are accelerating faster than our understanding and the law can keep pace. We will unravel the factors contributing to the seemingly pervasive failure of ethics today among organizations and leaders across all sectors: business, government, non-profit, and academia. A framework for ethical decision-making underpins the course. There is significant space for personal reflection and forming your own views on a wide range of issues.  Prominent guest speakers will attend certain sessions interactively. The relationship between ethics and culture, leadership, law, and global risks (inequality, privacy, financial system meltdown, cyber-terrorism, climate change, etc.) will inform discussion.  A broad range of international topics might include: designer genetics; civilian space travel (Elon Musk's Mars plans); social media (e.g. Facebook Cambridge Analytica, on-line sex trafficking, monopolies); new devises (e.g. Amazon Alexa in hotel rooms); free speech on University campuses; opioid addiction; AI (from racism to the work challenge and beyond); corporate and financial sector scandals (Epi pen pricing, Theranos, Wells Fargo fraudulent account creation, Volkswagen emissions testing manipulation); and non-profit sector ethics challenges (e.g. NGOs engagement with ISIS and sexual misconduct in humanitarian aid (Oxfam case)).  Final project in lieu of exam on a topic of student's choice. Attendance required. Class participation important (with multiple opportunities to earn participation credit beyond speaking in class). Strong emphasis on rigorous analysis, critical thinking and testing ideas in real-world contexts. Elements used in grading: Class Participation, Attendance, Written Assignments, and Final Paper. Cross-listed with Public Policy (PUBLPOL 134, PUBLPOL 234).

These laws, a mix of constitutional and statutory, state and federal, touch all of our lives, when we marry or divorce, or decide not marry an intimate partner, when we become parents, or decide not to become parents. Family Law provides the legal context, the background rules, pertaining to what are unquestionably the most important decisions in our lives-- the choice of a life partner, and whether to become a parent. In probing this body of law, we will also explore big questions about how the government should regulate people with respect to their intimate lives. Our first question: If marriage did not exist as a legal institution, would there be any good reason to create it as one?  Readings will be drawn from the professor's recently published (and revised) Casebook.

We will examine how laws and regulations affect the production, distribution, sale, and consumption of food and whether particular regulatory approaches (e.g., product bans, product standards, government subsidies, taxes, information disclosure, or labeling) are more effective in achieving public goals. The course can be conceived of as a form of applied administrative law and regulation, but no background is necessary. Instructions: Grades will be based on class attendance, class participation, and either several short reflection papers (section (01)) or an independent research paper (section (02)). After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2-4 units, depending on paper length.

        "description": "Workplace issues have become one of the fastest-growing areas of state and federal law. Employment-related lawsuits filed in federal court have tripled in volume in the past decade, and now account for a tenth of all civil cases. Many state courts have experienced a similar burgeoning of their employment law caseloads. This course examines this diverse, rewarding, and rapidly evolving area of legal practice by considering the diverse array of laws and institutions that regulate the employment relationship. The focus of the course is on laws that affect employees in non-unionized settings, such as protections against dismissal without cause, wage and hour restrictions, workplace privacy, covenants not to compete, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and mandatory arbitration of employment disputes. The course does not cover either Employment Discrimination or Labor Law, both of which are offered as separate courses. Special Instructions: Regular, punctual attendance is required. If you expect (or are unexpectedly forced) to miss more than two classes, please consult with the instructor as soon as possible, as exceptions will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Early Add/Drop Deadline: Add/Drop decisions must be made the first week of class. Exceptions are at the instructor's discretion and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

        "description": "From at least Brown v. Board of Education, and many would say before that, education has been central to racial justice movements in America. More than fifty years after Brown, most American schools remain segregated by race and class, and many advocates still argue that the struggle for quality education is the key civil rights issue of our time. This course will examine a host of education-related legal and policy issues that intersect with questions of race and class. Topics will include: desegregation and re-segregation, tracking, charter schools, school vouchers, high-stakes testing, the Common Core, school discipline, the &quot;school to prison pipeline,&quot; and education in alternative schools, juvenile facilities, and adult prisons. This will be a discussion-oriented course that will operate more like a seminar than a lecture.  This class is limited to 30 students, with an effort made to have students from SLS (20 students will be selected by lottery) and students from the School of Education (10 students).

The reproductive justice framework broadens the analysis to focus on the right to be a parent and the right to raise children in a safe and healthy environment, in addition to the right not to be a parent; it also employs intersectional analysis to emphasize the ways in which race, class, gender, sexuality, and other characteristics can affect a person's or community's reproductive lives. We will consider a range of legal and policy issues through these frameworks, including regulation of sexual behavior, sex education, contraception, abortion, assisted reproductive technology, pregnancy, childbirth, adoption, and parenting.  Grades will be based on attendance, class participation, and either written assignments (Section 01) or a long independent research paper for R-credit (Section 02).

The seminar is designed to allow students to understand and grapple with some of the doctrinal and strategic issues faced by social justice litigators.  The course will be informed by the instructor's thirty years of litigating cases, including in the Supreme Court, to advance immigrants' rights as the founder and former national director of the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project. Among the topics that may be included are selecting and using test cases; identifying plaintiffs; coalition litigation; strategic pleading; class action problems; the role of amicus briefs; suits for damages versus injunctive relief; standing and mootness; ethical problems; settlement strategies; use of public advocacy and media; the effect of lawsuits on policymakers and public officials; the role of government and agency lawyers; and litigation to achieve legislative change. Guest speakers will be invited. Enrollment is limited and the seminar is not open to 1L students. Students are expected to submit a series of reflections (totaling 18 pages) in response to seminar issues and guest speakers.

We will approach the material primarily through the lens of constitutional law, exploring how courts have used--or might use--federal or state constitutional provisions to address a wide array of issues involving gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation. The core of the class will relate to contemporary controversies concerning gender identity and sexual orientation (including, for example, how gender is defined, recognition of nonbinary identities, access to gender-affirming healthcare, relationship rights of same-sex couples, and religious liberty debates, among others), and will critically examine how legal regulation of gender and sexuality intersects with other identity-based categories including race, class, and disability. We will maintain an interdisciplinary focus throughout as we consider how social, cultural, and political forces shape, and are shaped by, legal doctrine.

        "description": "(Formerly Law 715B)  Recent events in our country have dramatically highlighted the fact that we are not a post-racial society, and that structural racism and implicit bias are as harmful to people and institutions as intentional discrimination.  Currently, plaintiffs can only show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment -  and several other antidiscrimination laws -  by proving intentional discrimination.  This seminar will examine this &quot;intent standard&quot; and its significant barriers to racial justice litigation.  The course will review social science research, including studies on implicit bias, racial anxiety, stereotyping, and other concepts, to explore how contemporary discrimination manifests.  We will address how legal advocates and the law can utilize such research to challenge and remedy discrimination through strategic litigation.  We will examine real-world examples of this, including in the context of school discipline and the school-to-prison pipeline.

        "description": "This seminar provides students with the opportunity to analyze, argue, hear oral arguments and draft opinions in cases that are currently pending before the Supreme Court of the United States. Professor Lawrence Marshall will serve as the instructor in the seminar, and several of the Law School's renowned Supreme Court litigators and other guests are expected to participate in one or more of the sessions. During each session, two students will present oral argument (based on the briefs that have been filed in the Court) to nine &quot;justices&quot; each of whose role is to reflect the jurisprudence and attitudes of the justice they are portraying over the course of the seminar. The nine &quot;justices&quot; will then conference the case and vote as they predict their justice will vote.  In this sense, the seminar is also intended to help promote insight into the role of judicial personality and philosophy within the decisional process. The cases chosen will provide a mix of constitutional and statutory issues, as well as a mix of criminal and civil cases. At the close of each session, one &quot;justice&quot; will be assigned to draft the majority opinion and other &quot;justice&quot; will be assigned to write the dissent. The other sitting &quot;justices&quot; can join one of these opinions, request some changes as a condition of joining, or decide to write separately. Special instructions: 1.

If so, by whose lights? Is she a political actor, or is she instead looking for a rule of decision that has been previously established by law (a &quot;mere translator&quot; of the law, in Justice Frankfurter's words). If so, by natural law or positive law? These are some of the questions we will consider in discussing what role a federal judge plays when she exercises &quot;the judicial Power of the United States&quot; conferred by Article III of the Constitution.

        "title": "The Welfare State",
        "description": "(Formerly Law 765)  Much has been written in recent years about the decline of the welfare state. Numerous adjectives have been applied to describe a trend toward austerity -- death, demise, withering, reversal. One writer suggested that the welfare state had not died, it had merely &quot;moved to Asia&quot; along with industrialization. This seminar introduces students to the key literature, questions, and debates about the modern welfare state. We will consider the emergence, growth, and current status of the welfare state, primarily in Western Europe and North America. The course will examine classical theories about markets and the emergence of social provision. We will also consider the leading theoretical and empirical research addressing the emergence of the welfare state, looking at the American case in comparative perspective. Attention will be paid to social and political factors on state development including political parties, labor markets, gender, demographic change, and immigration. We will then turn to the trend toward austerity and retrenchment, and the effect of globalization for the future of the welfare state.  Course Requirements.  Participation/Discussion (25%). Students are responsible to complete all readings and to come to class prepared to actively participate in discussion. Each student is responsible to lead a portion of the discussion twice per quarter.  Short Reaction Papers (25%). All students must complete 5 reaction papers related to the weekly readings of 2 to 3 pages in length. Reaction papers will include a list of questions to be addressed in that week's discussion. All reaction papers must be posted to coursework in advance of class so that the student(s) leading that week's discussion can incorporate the questions into that week's discussion.  Final Options (50%). Students have the option of completing one final paper of 20 pages in length OR 4 essays of 5 -6 pages each addressing the readings in weeks that the student did NOT complete reaction papers. Topics for 20 page papers must be approved by me in advance, and may be related to a student's dissertation or master's research or may be a stand-alone topic. Papers may take the form of a research proposal and need not contain original empirical research. Shorter papers should engage thoroughly with the literature on the selected topic, and should bring additional sources other than those read for class to bear on the topic of choice.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

Please contact me directly if you have questions about the class and I will email you a more readable description. Thanks, MLD.  Seminar with Concurrent Policy Lab: Rethinking Campus and School Title IX Policies and Procedures.  Policy Lab Client: National Women's Law Center:  Over the past six years, the issue of campus sexual assault has exploded into the public discourse. While definitive figures are difficult to obtain due to the necessarily private nature of these events, several recent studies estimate that between 20-25% of college women (and a similar proportion of students identifying as transgender and gender-nonconforming, as well as around 5-10% of male students) experience sexual assault. Survivors have come forward across the country with harrowing stories of assault followed by an insensitive or indifferent response from college administrators, launching one of the most successful, and surprising, social movements in recent memory. Statistics are equally disturbing in the middle and high school context. As a result, the federal government under President Obama stepped up its civil rights enforcement in this area, with over 250 colleges and universities currently under investigation for allegedly mishandling student sexual assault complaints. At the same time, students accused of sexual assault have complained of botched processes driven by a &quot;campus rape over-correction&quot; that denied them a fair disciplinary hearing. It is clear that schools are struggling to develop and implement policies and procedures that satisfy their legal obligations in this area. While the future of federal enforcement under the Trump Administration is uncertain, schools are still subject to federal and state law that require them have policies and procedures to address sexual harassment and violence.  This course focuses on the legal and policy issues surrounding the highly challenging area of investigation and adjudication of sexual assault and other gender-motivated violence on college campuses and in K12 schools. It will cover the federal and state legal frameworks governing these procedures including Title IX, the Violence Against Women Act, and the Clery Act, and examine current cases as well as the rapidly-evolving legal, federal regulatory, and political environment surrounding this issue. Guest speakers working in the area will help to broaden the class's understanding of the subject matter. Students in this seminar will have the opportunity to participate in the invitation-only national conference entitled The Way Forward: Title IX Advocacy in the Trump Era, which will be held May 1-2 at Stanford Law School and is organized in conjunction with the National Women's Law Center. See [http://conferences.law.stanford.edu/thewayforward-title9/] for more information on the conference.  Concurrent Seminar and Policy Lab:  The seminar is taught concurrently with the Policy Lab (also entitled &quot;Rethinking Campus and School Title IX Policies and Procedures&quot;). All students registered for the seminar participate in the Policy Lab, which works with the National Women's Law Center toward the development of a set of evidence-based and legally compliant model policies and procedures. Given all the controversy, surprisingly little is actually known about the policies and processes that are currently in use, nor is there any way of easily ascertaining what the majority of an institution's &quot;peer schools&quot; are doing with respect to solving a challenge or addressing an issue. There is no set of &quot;best practices&quot; to which school administrators can easily turn. Students will analyze cutting-edge issues related to school-based gender-motivated violence and work on a white paper for the NWLC that includes both legal and empirical research into the policies and procedures currently in use around the country. Throughout the class, students will have the opportunity to reflect on what they are learning and how it applies in a professional context. The eventual goal of this Policy Lab is the development in conjunction with NWLC of a free, web-based, open-source set of adaptable model policies and procedures that are targeted for different market segments (i.e., large private, large public, small private, HBCU, community colleges, and k12).  Course Schedule and Optional Travel:  The first three weeks of the class there will be two meetings per week, on Tuesday and Thursday from 4:15 to 6:15. Students will meet with Fatima Goss Graves, Senior Vice President for Program at the NWLC during week 2 to hear her expectations regarding the project and ask questions. During weeks 4-6 the class will meet once per week, on Thursday from 4:15-7:15 and small groups will work on their assigned sections of the project. On Thursday, May 4 (week 5), the class will meet with special guest Catherine Lhamon, former Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights and have the opportunity to discuss the project with her and receive her feedback. During Week 7, the class will take an optional trip to Washington DC to present the completed project to the staff of the NWLC on Friday May 19. The class will be housed at Stanford in Washington from Thursday May 18, and will attend a hearing of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission in the morning of May 19 and then present their project in the afternoon. Travel expenses (other than incidentals) are provided. On Saturday, May 20 we will have the option to meet with other policy makers and activists as well as sightsee (including an attempted visit to the National Museum of African American History). We will return to Stanford on Sunday May 21. There will be no class during week 8.  Enrollment, Assignments, and Evaluation; The Seminar and concurrent policy lab are both open to law students, graduate students, and advanced undergraduates. The seminar has two sections. Section 1 is a 2-hour seminar and students enrolling in Section 1 must also enroll in the Law 805R Policy Lab (1-hour). Section 2 is a 3-hour seminar, and students may enroll in that Section without concurrent enrollment in the Policy Lab. Regardless of the section of enrollment, all students will do the same assignments and be evaluated on the same criteria. All students will complete written work equivalent to a 26 page research paper. Law students will receive &quot;R&quot; credit for the seminar.  Elements used in grading:  Performance, Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Paper.

        "description": "(Formerly Law 280)  This seminar will examine the concerns arising from exposure to toxic substances from a variety of perspectives. A principal focus will be tort liability, and a central theme in the course will be whether tort law is an effective method of compensating victims of toxic exposure and controlling the distribution and/or emission of toxic substances. In order to assess the efficacy of tort, it is essential to compare the liability system with alternatives such as restructured &quot;public law&quot; litigation, administrative compensation schemes, and regulatory control strategies. Moreover, it seems equally important that these options be grounded in a concrete understanding of the major current problem areas.  To accomplish these aims, the course will focus on a number of specific present concerns, including tobacco, asbestos, anti-inflammatory drugs, and workplace emissions exposures. In each instance, we will look at the nature of the public health problem as well as ensuing tort litigation and regulatory activity. In addition to examining these distinctive problem areas, we will look at broader, cross-cutting institutional reform proposals that have received recent attention.  Students in Section (01) will write three ten-page writing exercises on topics discussed in class.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), and have the option to write a final independent research paper for Research credit, with instructor consent.

        "description": "This course examines major transformations in American law brought about by the momentous social and political movements of the mid- to late 20th Century. Part I deals with the response of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal to the economic catastrophe of the Great Depression. The New Deal resulted in a major expansion -- against the resistance of conservative courts -- in the size and responsibilities of the Federal government to regulate the economy and secure citizens against risks of unemployment, sickness and old age. Part II covers the expansion of the New Deal after World War II to new forms of welfare and regulation (such as Medicare and environmental law) and what we now call the Rights Revolution --movements of subordinated or marginalized groups to claim equal rights (African-Americans, women, the disabled, gays and lesbians) or fair treatment by government (criminal suspects, welfare recipients, mental patients, prisoners). Part III: Both the New Deal and the Rights Revolution provoked fierce political reactions in which the modern conservative movements arose and came to power.

The roots, development, and pathologies of post-structural theory will be a central preoccupation of the course, as will the tensions between post-structuralism and the premises of liberal democratic thought.  Major works by a range of theorists (such as Marx, Freud, Nietzsche, Benjamin, Fanon, Lacan, Foucault, Bhabba, Butler, Said, Chakrabarty, Haraway, Crenshaw, Ranciere, and Agamben) will be situated in relation to historical and theoretical interpretations of discrete 19th and 20th century resistance movements.

        "title": "Children Sexuality and the Law",
        "description": "This seminar focuses on federal and state law designed to protect children from sexual exploitation, as well as federal constitutional law regulating young adults' expressive rights with regard to gender and sexual identity.  The seminar provides a general introduction to some of the laws governing children's sexual autonomy as well as necessary protections from sexual abuse; however, the seminar's primary purpose is to teach students about how the law discursively constructs children as it attempts to protect them.  Specifically, students will explore how laws designed to protect children from sexual exploitation also naturalize certain assumptions about children's perceptions, cognitive capacities, interests and vulnerabilities.  Our discussions will explore how the law, while attempting to catalogue and regulate the potential threats children face, also instantiates certain ideas about children's potential sex-related injuries and how these injures can affect them over time.  Finally, seminar discussions will explore whether there are any inconsistencies between the understanding of childhood, sexual injury, capacity, and autonomy in various areas of state child protection laws, federal constitutional law, and relevant federal statutes.  In addition to considering how laws regulating children's sexuality affect children, the seminar will also examine how the same laws effectively constrain adults' behavior, as well as shape our understanding of the role of certain social institutions. Laws intended to more generally protect children from sexual exploitation also regulate children's relationships to their parents, affect our understanding of the role of schools, and even our understanding of the role libraries and the internet play in educating citizens.  Seminar discussions will focus on how discursive constructs and social understandings about children contained in law both constrain and enable us in discussions of child sexuality.  We will also consider how these constructs and understandings empower certain institutions by legitimating certain kinds of intervention.  Students can choose to write three short response papers for two units or a final research paper for three units.

This is a controversial approach (as are the others) and we will read and consider critics as well as proponents, so that students can make up their own minds. The first part of the seminar will be devoted to the theory: how it works, what are its justifications, what are its flaws, the various versions. The remainder will be devoted to specific applications. Because there are far more topics than we have time to cover, students will vote on the first day for which topics we will take up. Among the choices are: segregation, executive power, speech and press, the Ninth Amendment, affirmative action, gun rights, abortion, searches and seizures, and freedom of religion. Two students will assist in leading class discussions. Elements used in grading: Grades will be based 20% on participation and 80% on papers.

        "description": "This seminar is an advanced course on immigration law and policy designed for students who have taken the basic immigration law course or have equivalent academic or work exposure to immigration law, foundational constitutional principles, and the functioning of the immigration system and immigration agencies. The class will explore a range of topics or issues that are not covered in the survey course. Topics may include: discrimination against noncitizens by private and public entities, workplace and labor rights of noncitizens, asylum protection and border enforcement, immigration federalism and the role of states, judicial review and separation of powers, selected issues arising in current immigration litigation before the Supreme Court and lower courts.  We are unlikely to cover all these issues, and topic selection may be adjusted based on student interest and input. Guest speakers may be invited for some topics. Students must fill out a consent form and have academic or equivalent grounding in the basics of immigration law. Elements used in grading: Class participation and attendance (30%); reflection papers or a final research paper (70%). After the term begins, students enrolled in the course can transfer (with instructor consent) from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement.

        "title": "One in Five: The Law, Politics, and Policy of Campus Sexual Assault",
        "description": "CW: SA/GBV: Access the Application Consent Form Here:  (TBA).  Over the past decade the issue of campus sexual assault and harassment has exploded into the public discourse. Multiple studies have reinforced the finding that between 20-25% of college women (and a similar proportion of students identifying as transgender and gender-nonconforming, as well as approximately 10% of male students) experience sexual assault carried out through force or while the victim was incapacitated during their time in college. Fraternities have been found to be associated with an increased risk of female sexual assault on campus. Vulnerable students and those from marginalized groups are often found to be at increased risk. This is also a significant problem in k12 education. Sexual harassment rates are even higher. Intimate partner violence, stalking, and online harassment are also significant problems on campuses. Survivors have come forward across the country with harrowing stories of abuse followed by what they describe as an insensitive or indifferent response from college administrators. These survivors have launched one of the most successful, and surprising, social movements in recent memory. As a result, the federal government under President Obama stepped up its civil rights enforcement in this area, with over 300 colleges and universities under investigation for allegedly mishandling student sexual assault complaints as of the end of that administration. At the same time, the Obama administration's heightened response led to a series of high-profile lawsuits by accused students who assert that they were falsely accused or subjected to mishandled investigations that lacked sufficient due process protections. The one thing that survivors and accused students appear to agree on is that colleges are not handling these matters appropriately and appeared to be more concerned with protection the institutional brand than with stopping rape or protecting student rights. Colleges have meanwhile complained of being whipsawed between survivors, accused students, interest groups, and enforcement authorities. In an about-face that many found shocking, the Trump Administration rescinded all of the Obama-era guidance on the subject of sexual harassment and has promulgated new proposed regulations that would offer significantly greater protection to accused students and to institutions and commensurately less protection to survivors. An increasingly partisan Congress has been unable to pass legislation addressing the issue. The Biden Administration recently put forward significantly re-worked proposed regulations to undo what survivors saw as the harm of the Trump-era regulations. This course focuses on the legal, policy, and political issues surrounding sexual assault and harassment on college campuses. Each week we will read, dissect, compare and critique a set of readings that include social science, history, literature, legal, policy, journalism, and narrative explorations of the topic of campus sexual assault. We will explore the history of gender-based violence and the efforts to implement legal protections for survivors in the educational context. We will also study the basic legal frameworks governing campus assault, focusing on the relevant federal laws such as Title IX and the Clery Act. We will critically explore the ways that responses to this violence have varied by the race, class, gender identity, sexual orientation, and other characteristics of parties and institutions. We will hear from guest speakers who are actively involved in shaping policy and advocating in this area, including lawyers, survivors, activists, medical professionals, and policymakers. The subject matter of this course is sensitive, and students are expected to treat the material with maturity. Much of the reading and subject matter may be upsetting and/or triggering for students who identify as survivors. There is no therapeutic component for this course, although supportive campus resources are available for those who need them. Elements used in grading: Grades will be based on class attendance, class participation, and either several short reflection papers and a class presentation (Law section 01) or an independent research paper and class presentation, or a project and class presentation (undergraduates, graduates, and Law section 02). After the term begins, law students accepted into the course can transfer from section 01 into section 02, which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. This class has both in-person and remote components. Enrollment is by INSTRUCTOR PERMISSION. Access the application consent form (TBA) or contact Professor Dauber at mldauber@gmail.com to request a form via email. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis until the class is full. Demand for the class is high and participation is capped at 18. The class usually fills quickly, so make sure to apply early.

        "description": "This course will consider a number of current issues of law and policy that achieved prominence during the Presidency of Barack Obama and remain unresolved.  These issues include: 1) immigration law reform and DACA, 2) the role of the Department of Justice in reforming local and federal criminal law enforcement, 3) the role of government policy in regulating the economy and financial system, in facilitating heath insurance, and in remedying economic inequality, 4) the proper balance between national security and civil liberties/human rights, as exemplified by the debates over the status of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and drone warfare.  In each of these areas, and others, debates about law and policy had reached a seeming, or potential, consensus in early 2009, but that consensus quickly fell apart.  In each area, the gap between differing formulations of law and policy that had existed until recently has widened.  Keeping in mind the time limitations of this course, we will briefly examine most of these of law and policy -- the governing legal doctrines and policies, their evolution since 2009, and their present and future prospects.  The course will ask: What accounts for these differing visions of law and policy? What accounts for the inability of the political and legal system to resolve them?  What are the possible ways forward?  Class format will consist mainly of readings and class discussion, and students are encouraged to bring their own perspectives to bear on these difficult and timely issues.

Judges sentence defendants based on &quot;risk scores;&quot; regulators take enforcement actions based on predicted violations; advertisers target materials based on demographic attributes; and employers evaluate applicants and employees based on machine-learned models.

Algorithms might discriminate, for instance, based on race or gender.  This course surveys the legal principles for assessing bias of algorithms, examines emerging techniques for how to design and assess bias of algorithms, and assesses how antidiscrimination law and the design of algorithms may need to evolve to account for the potential emergence of machine bias.

In recent decades, though, marriage has undergone unprecedented changes. Sustained political advocacy and judicial decisions have opened marriage to same sex couples. Yet marriage equality has triumphed at a time when marriage is less universal and less robust as a social institution than ever. More American adults than ever are unmarried; more than a third of those who do marry will divorce. Unprecedented numbers of children are now born to unmarried parents. And marriage rates and stability have diverged across racial and socioeconomic groups as never before.  What is one to make of these changes? And how should law and policy respond?  The course will examine the constitutional and statutory doctrine governing marriage and other intimate relationships.  Throughout, we will consider the cultural and social understandings that undergird our past and current approaches to regulating intimate relationships.

        "description": "In recent years, selective universities have become more academically selective than ever. During the past half century their applicant pools have grown considerably--now including women, minorities, immigrants, and international students--while the sizes of their student bodies remain virtually unchanged. The broader social and economic context has shifted as well. With globalization, the advance of technology and the resulting labor market shifts, advanced education is seen as more important than ever to getting ahead. Yet, even as elite universities seem central to Americans' hopes and dream, they have also come under attack, viewed as disconnected from, and alien to, &quot;regular Americans.&quot; This course will engage these developments through considering a pivotal question: How do and should elite educational institutions choose among the many applicants vying for admission? Two principles loom large in the ethos of selective college admissions: diversity and merit. Throughout the course, we will take a critical stance toward these claims. For example, how much does and should merit shape admissions decisions? What are the rationales for using prior grades and test scores to assess applicants? Similarly, what are the costs and benefit of the diversity rationale? Should schools take account of race, socioeconomic class, or neither? Course readings will include judicial opinions and legal commentary, social science evidence and cultural criticism.

In so doing, it will examine: 1) the Senate's nature as a complex legal institution, and 2) the issue of the Senate's legitimacy in the context of the current and largely unprecedented criticism of the Senate from all parts of the political spectrum. This first portion of the course will consider institutional-legitimacy issues facing the Senate, including the appointment of senators to fill vacancies as well as disputes concerning Senate rules and procedures such as the filibuster and holds. The second part of the course will explore how the Senate interfaces with the Constitution and the Supreme Court. It will examine how senators should regard the issue of constitutionality in voting on legislation, be it campaign-finance reform, internet decency, or health care. This part of the course will also consider how senators should approach proposed constitutional amendments. The final portion of the course will review the wide range of issues that have emerged in recent years regarding the constitutional relationship between the Senate and the Executive Branch, including the increasingly acrimonious issue of the standard to apply to executive appointments under the advice and consent power. Particular emphasis on this part of the course will be given to issues that have gained greater prominence since 9/11, including the relationship between enacted, constitutional legislation and the presidential assertion of Article II powers, as well as the Senate's abdication of its Article I war-declaration power.

        "description": "This is a seminar for students with some background and interest in immigration and administrative law based on prior coursework, clinic enrollment, academic study, or other experience who want to engage in an examination of the administrative process for pursuing reform. The course will examine some of the current contested immigration policy changes and consider the mechanisms for achieving positive reform in light of administrative law and practice.  The goal is to identify strategies and mechanisms for future reform that would further the protections of non-citizens during a period of global hostility to migrants. One significant part of the course will be contributing to a project that tracks and catalogues all the immigration policy changes of the Trump administration. Students will also develop proposals for future non-legislative reform through administrative action.  The seminar will examine the federal administrative process from a theoretical, doctrinal, and practical perspective based on selected readings, guest speakers, and the instructor's experience as senior immigration policy advisor in the Obama administration at the Department of Homeland Security and as founder and former director of the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project. Requirements: Some prior exposure to immigration law or practice in a work, clinical, professional, academic, or other setting. Elements used in grading: Grades will be based on class attendance, class participation, and either writing assignments (Section 01) or, with the instructor's permission, an independent research paper (Section 02).  A very limited number of students may be permitted to write the long research paper for R credit but only with the prior specific approval of the instructor.

        "title": "Amending the U.S. Constitution",
        "description": "This seminar explores the legal and historical dimensions of the American constitutional amendment process as well as its current and potential role in our political system and public debate. The principal focus will be on Article V of the Constiution but we will also briefly examine the way in which the Constitution is said by some to be &quot;amendable&quot; (and to have already been &quot;amended&quot;) through alternate means apart from Article V. The seminar will enable students both critically to evaluate the myriad aspects of constitutional amendments and conventions using proper source material and to develop their own proposals for potential amendments.  The first part of the course will first explore the origins of Article V, including background on the comparative amendability of other written constitutions, the adoption of the Bill of Rights, and the apparent unamendability of the provision in Article V requiring equal representation of the states in the Senate.  We will then review the history of efforts--both successful and unsuccessful--to amend the Constitution, such as the early corrective amendments to the post-Civil War Reconstruction amendments, the Progressive Era amendments (e.g., the switch to the direct election of Senators), and the modern voting-related amendments. This section will also consider views about when and how it is proper or &quot;appropriate&quot; to amend the Constitution, the standard that members of Congress should employ in voting on proposed amendments, and the history of calls for constitutional conventions to amend the Constitution.  The second part of the course will explore the current possibility of a constitutional convention or conventions being called independently of Congressional initiative including the question of whether the scope of such a convention could be limited. We will then examine the relatively recent and current proposals and advocacy for and against constitutional amendments across the political spectrum. For this portion of the course, we will particularly consider the balanced budget amendment, the state veto amendment,  the victims' rights amendment, and the elimination of the direct election of Senators, from the conservative side of that spectrum. We will then particularly highlight the movement to overturn Citizens United by amendment, the elimination of the electoral college amendment, the proposal to overturn Heller (right to bear arms) by amendment, and the current effort to revive and ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, all mostly associated with the progressive or liberal side of the spectrum.  For the final seminar, students will be asked to give in class their opinion of Article V and whether it is too easy or difficult (or just right) in terms of allowing amendments. Each student will also be asked briefly to propose and defend an amendment that that student believes should be added to the Constitution.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer, with consent of the instructor, from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement.

        "title": "Family Law II: Parent-Child Relationships",
        "description": "This course will examine the legal regulation of the parent-child relationship. The law used to be much simpler than it is today.  The law treated marriage as the near exclusive setting for the rearing of children, defining the woman who gave birth to the child was the mother, and the man to whom she was married as the father.  In recent decades, that simple legal principle has collapsed under the weight of social and technological change. The central social change is the reconfiguration of marriage and the multiplicity of settings in which children are raised. The advent of same sex marriage and same sex couples undermine longstanding assumptions about the legal definition of parent. And the fact that 4 in every 10 children are born to unmarried couples, and that nearly half of all married couples will divorce (often with either or both partners remarrying) introduce a dizzying array of possible family configurations.  Advances in genetic testing complicate matters further, by allowing biological parents to be identified with near certainty. Thus, there is less reason to treat a woman's husband as her child's father. Many couples use reproductive technologies involving the donation of sperm, the donation of eggs or even the use of a surrogate mother to gestate the child. The use of such technologies can result in many adults having some form of tie to the child, a situation that has prompted some jurisdictions to recognize the possibilities of more than 2 parents!  In sum, nonmarital, nonbiological, and same-sex parenting have become central, rather than peripheral features of the familial landscape. These changes highlight provocative and fundamental inquiries: What, exactly, does, and should, make one a parent in the view of the law? And how should the state allocate rights and responsibilities, related to custody, financial support and visitation, as families fracture and reconfigure?

This course will examine the legacies of atrocities and the institutions and processes that governments and citizens most often use to address them, comparing approaches from across the globe. South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission; the prosecution of Chile's former dictator, Augusto Pinochet; Argentina's reparations to victims of its military regime; and the International Criminal Court are among the best-known policy responses to those problems. In addition, non-legal interventions---such as the Berlin Holocaust Memorial and Nelson Mandela's many symbolic gestures toward reconciliation with white South Africans---may have important social and political effects. In addition to initiatives at the national and international levels, we will devote some attention to transitional justice at the local level. A recurring theme throughout the course will be the connections between atrocities and transitional justice measures intended to address them, on the one hand, and economic justice and development, on the other.

        "description": "Federal, state and local laws prohibit discrimination based on many grounds such as race, sex, religion, national origin and disability.  But the operative term, &quot;discrimination,&quot; is typically quite vaguely defined in statutory language.  As a consequence, courts and legal analysts have developed a number of theories of discrimination.  These theories can be inconsistent with each other and with popular definitions of discrimination; for instance, some laws forbidding &quot;discrimination&quot; forbid differential treatment, some permit it under limited circumstances and some require it.  Discrimination may or not require a specific mental state (&quot;discriminatory intent&quot;) or specific consequences (&quot;discriminatory effect&quot; or &quot;disparate impact&quot;).  Arguably, &quot;discrimination&quot; is, in practice, as much a question of values and norms as it is a matter of fact.  This class will explore the concept of discrimination in case law, philosophy and legal theory.

The course will explore the tension between (a) race as a social phenomenon that is transnational if not global in scope and (b) the construction of race in contemporary international law, where it is often treated as a domestic matter of non-discrimination norms in human rights law. The course will also examine the present-day legacies of international legal norms and institutions connected to slavery and formal colonialism. Materials will be drawn from contemporary UN human rights mechanisms, state practice and case law, and legal claims by anti-colonial/racial justice movements.

        "title": "Gender, Sexuality and Reproduction",
        "description": "This mini-course revisits the core elements that have traditionally defined family law: gender, sexuality and reproduction. Historically, family law had two main functions. It created a framework for bearing and raising children, and organized the children's parents' coupledom. Gender, sexuality and reproduction were closely interwoven and subject to certain expectations. Sex was only allowed in the context of marriage, which formed the gateway to reproduction. Children born outside of wedlock had inferior rights. Women were placed under their husband's control to ensure their sexual fidelity.  From the 1960's on, societal changes shook the traditional conception of the family to its foundations. Women gained economic independence and started challenging their traditional role in the family. Birth control cut the ties between sexuality and reproduction. The position of marriage as the sole seat of both coupledom and childbearing started to erode. The disconnection of gender, sexuality and reproduction opened family law up to new questions. Why should marriage only be possible between a man and a woman? Can children have more than two legal parents? What is the extent of the reproductive rights of women and men? Is marriage still a relevant legal concept?  These and other questions are tackled from a comparative law angle, comparing the approach in the United States and other Western jurisdictions. Students are asked to reflect on the various responses to contemporary family law issues across the Western world. The focus is on general tendencies, not on technicalities. Grades will be based on regular attendance, active class participation and one short response paper.  This class will meet the first three weeks of the quarter on Thursday, January 9, 16, and 23.",

Based on the course readings and our discussions, those supporting a more limited role of government will be pushed to defend this position and articulate its possible risks and benefits.

Materials will primarily be original source texts, supplemented by selected secondary literature. The majority of class time will be devoted to discussion, based on close reading of the materials. Students will be assigned to take the lead on class discussion on particular topics. Topics will include: (1) the constitutional status of slavery prior to the Civil War; (2) the Emancipation Proclamation; (3) the Thirteenth Amendment; (4) the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and President Johnson's constitutional veto; (4) drafting and ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, with special emphasis on the citizenship clause, due process, equal protection, privileges and immunities, and congressional enforcement; (5) the Freedman's Bureau Act, Ku Klux Klan Act, Enforcement Acts, and Civil Rights Act of 1871; (6) the Fifteenth Amendment; (7) the Civil Rights Act of 1875; (8) early Supreme Court interpretations, and (9) the collapse of Reconstruction and rise of Jim Crow. Within these topics, we will discuss segregation, affirmative action, the state action doctrine, equality with respect to non-racial characteristics, ratification rules, state sovereign immunity, and the role of electoral politics in constitutional interpretation and enforcement. Note: This is NOT a course on current interpretations of the Reconstruction Amendments, but on their historical background.  There are no prerequisites. First year law students and non-law students are welcome. Constitutional Law would be helpful but is not required.  Grading. Grades will be based partly (20%) on class participation, and partly on either an in-class exam or a research paper on a topic approved in advance by the instructor. Students will choose between the exam and the paper. Grades for students will be on the Honors/Pass/Restrd Cr/Fail system.

It will also explore how the primary remedial tool for addressing excesses in policing--42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, enacted in the Klu Klux Klan Act of 1871 and the third Enforcement statute passed after the Civil War--has functioned. Attention will be given to the criminalization of blackness (and other non-white groups), the pathologies of force, and the development of legal rules (e.g., immunity doctrines and standards concerning municipal liability) in Section 1983 litigation. Casework and litigation strategies will be set alongside readings, both theoretical and pragmatic, drawing from the fields of remedies; political philosophy; legal realism and critical race theory; and traditional doctrine. Students will write several brief reflection papers (roughly two pages) exploring how the assigned readings bear on the general themes of the course, and broader reactions to the readings.  A longer paper (roughly 7-8 pages) about any topic related to race and policing is also required. Elements used in grading:  Grading will be based on the papers and class participation.",

        "description": "America's social safety net--from health insurance to food support to housing assistance to unemployment insurance--was built over many years and embedded into America's system of federalism, a partnership between the federal and state governments, and America's deep-rooted commitment to a public-private model of shared risk and shared responsibility between the government and private employers. Our safety net is intended to provide a floor to prevent poverty and destitution, to support workers and their families when work is not available either due to the economy or to personal circumstances, and it is intended to also provide for basic human needs such as food, medicine and shelter. The COVID-19 induced recession with millions of lost jobs, lost wages and severe global economic disruption provided the greatest stress test to our modern safety net.  This seminar will examine the structure, law and policies of America's social insurance system and safety net. We will examine these social programs through a combination of theoretical readings, court cases, practical policy proposals, and lessons learned from how the system worked or failed during the great stress test provided by COVID-19 and the ensuing recession. The course aims to spur critical thinking about the proper role of government in protecting against certain risks, as well as the appropriate target of the government's interventions. The course will also consider how the changing nature of work, family, technology and the private sector has played in disrupting the existing social safety net and what considerations should be taken into account to strengthen and build the next generation social safety net in America.

        "title": "Judging in the 21st Century",
        "description": "Since your first week of law school, you have been reading legal opinions written by judges.  Who were those judges and did their identities affect their views?  From a judge's perspective, what makes a case hard or easy?  Did the process by which the judge was selected--or could be removed from office--influence her or his decision?  How do judges make choices about the larger legal ecosystem in which you will practice law?  After all, judges determine many aspects of the legal environment in which lawyers operate, from whether you can livestream a court hearing from your phone to whether you will take the bar exam in person or online.  Taught by a Justice on a California Court of Appeal, this seminar explores judicial decision making about cases and the court system from a variety of perspectives.  It draws from accounts by social scientists, lawyers, and judges themselves, analyzing what judges do and critiquing how they do it.  The seminar examines systems of judicial selection, evaluation, and removal in both the federal and state court systems and their potential effects on judicial decision making.  We will take up questions such as whether the identity of judges matters to their decisions, how heuristics or implicit biases might influence outcomes, how communities try to choose &quot;good&quot; judges and what they do when those choices go wrong, evaluate efforts to diversify the bench, and consider what lessons might be learned from the experiences of various states in evaluating and electing judges.  One theme of the seminar involves the interaction of judges with litigants, the public, and other government actors--on twenty-first-century terms.  We will ask how courts should manage questions related to transparency, privacy, access to justice, and technology.  We will think about how judges might choose or be compelled to rely on emerging automation technologies, whether simple algorithms or advanced machine learning.  We also will consider the extent to which judges do and should take into account the views of executive officials, legislators, nongovernmental organizations, and members of the general public when deciding cases and structuring the legal system.  In addition, we will look at ethics rules governing what judges can learn and what they can say.  For example, can or should a judge run an experiment that tests a litigant's factual assertion, or, in her free time, write an online product review, lead a religious group, or participate in a commission to improve state government?  The seminar will pursue these questions from both theoretical and practical perspectives.  Sitting judges from a variety of courts will share their insights with seminar participants.  Students will write a research paper on a relevant topic of their choice, and will be encouraged to think critically about how judges make decisions and how courts can be improved in realistic ways.  We will think together about how judges and courts can best deliver justice in a changing, contested, unequal, and increasingly complex world.

Traditionally, state constitutional law has been a neglected body of law. That may begin to change, as the U.S. Supreme Court makes significant changes to federal constitutional law. We will consider both big-picture questions and many specific areas of law. For example, we will explore a central normative debate about whether state courts interpreting their own state's constitution should follow the approaches to cognate provisions in the federal constitution embraced by the Supreme Court. We will also consider questions about the role of elected judges in constitutional interpretation, and about the processes through which state constitutions are amended. Specific issues we will study include educational equality and school funding; marriage; reproductive rights; race and gender discrimination; criminal justice; election law; and affirmative rights under state constitutions, among others. We will also look at the role of state attorneys general and prosecutors in law reform efforts. I expect to have one or more guest speakers.

        "title": "Record-Pressed Revolution:  Black Auditory Advocacy and the Late Civil Rights Movement",
        "description": "The movement had all but ended--Malcolm and Martin twin Moseses toward the new decade's Canaan, their people at once led to and lost in Equal Right's promised land. Two Kennedys and administrations sat lost to the threshold too. Tribute to the 60s--many hands made the law's lords work. &quot;The Revolution&quot;--now sponsored by Black Power, deep base, and less faith--was underway, and everywhere. It would not, though, be brought to you/ by Xerox in four parts without commercial interruptions' or show you pictures of Nixon blowing a bugle. Gil told us. The old revolution was dead, long live the Revolution.  Much has been written on the turn charted in Scott-Heron's Black Power anthem, expressing the sentiments of a community left to grapple with the consequences of a &quot;rights&quot; mission seen as, but by no means actually, accomplished. The fight for Civil Rights--at least of the sort a government could give--had ended, in no small part thanks to death, disillusionment, and a right-wing government elected by equality's opponents to trim its imagined excesses. Expressed amidst the violence and propaganda of America's smoldering wars (in Vietnam, on dissent, and on dissenters), Scott-Heron's critique of televised politics reads as a response, in part, to the power asymmetries inscribed in the form, as well as the content, of broadcast images. The Revolution would not be televised, because in truth it could not be. It could, though, be reproduced via other means: through sound. Pressed, packaged, and delivered (cheap!) to a living room near you, thanks to Phillips, RCA Victor, media mail postage (which is to say Uncle Sam), and countless others. No less baggage, just different. The Revolution could not be televised, but it could be played for audiences at home. That Revolution--the type pressed in wax along with ink--is the focus of this course. In this study, the Revolution will be considered, listened to, and, if successful, &quot;will be no rerun,[it] will be live.&quot; Course Focus:  In taking up the media and mechanisms of advocacy animating the Black Power spirit Scott-Heron captures, this course turns our attention backward, revisiting the American moment out of which Scott-Heron's contemporary was born. Keeping the Black Power Movement back-of-mind, this course focuses its attention on the late American Civil Rights era (1963-1969), re-examining Rights Advocacy in this moment through the prism of socio-cultural, rather than institutional, legal and (small c) constitutional change. Reading popular media as a flattened space for socio-legal argumentation, this course traces how a culture moves through and with a populace to reshape conceptions of justice and legality. In doing so, we approach popular media as a critical interlocutor with traditionally privileged socio-legal discourses. Putting the two in conversation, this course aims to rebalance examinations of Black Rights discourse, de-centering rhetorical and legal rights advocacy in examining the rights claims advanced in the period. In doing so, we hope to better understand the mechanisms of socio-legal change, as well as the late Rights Era's relationship to its Black Power permutation.

        "title": "Lawyering for Change: A Case Study in Efforts to Abolish the Death Penalty",
        "description": "Over the past fifty years, there have been dramatic ebbs and flows in support for, and application of, the death penalty in the United States. Lawyers have played key roles in these shifts--through their in-court work and through other forms of organizing and advocacy. We will begin the seminar by examining the law and politics regarding the Supreme Court's invalidation of all death penalty statutes in 1972, and the central roles lawyers played in that result. We will then turn to states' successful efforts (advanced by lawyers) to secure judicial approval of revised capital-punishment systems in 1976. For the 20 years that followed, support for capital punishment continued to grow, and no state had come close to abolishing the death penalty. Over the past 15 years, by contrast, ten states have abolished capital punishment, and three other states have in place moratoria on executions. The number of death sentences imposed nationally, which reached 315 in 1996, has been 18 for each of the past two years. This seminar endeavors to understand the rise and fall of the death penalty by way of an extended case study of the State of Illinois--a particularly interesting jurisdiction because of the dramatic events leading to abolition and the rapid pace of change: in an eight-year period, it went from a death row of 171 to outright abolition of the death penalty. We will focus especially on the roles that lawyers played in bringing about this transformation, both in their service on individual cases and also as advocates in the service of a movement. The aim of the seminar is to invite a broad, yet critical understanding of the ways in which lawyers have been and can be instruments of social change--lessons that resonate well beyond the field of capital punishment. Students may elect to write a substantial research paper (on a topic to be decided upon after consultation with the instructor) or a series of short response papers. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.",

Each of the episodes has raised anxieties about the capacity of the constitutional order to resolve severe conflict. Much current constitutional doctrine emerged from them.  Topics include the Civil War, the New Deal, and the Civil Rights Movement; the dispossession of the Cherokee Indians in the Jackson era and the internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II; the elections of 1800, 1876, 2000, and 2020; and the impeachments of Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton.

        "description": "Temporary leaders exist in almost every sector--acting cabinet secretaries, interim chief executive officers, interim university presidents, temporary pastors, interim coaches, to name just a few. In many roles, they abound as more permanent leaders are often missing. In some sectors, they are women and persons of color, breaking into roles that they had not held before. Commentators often lump temporary leaders into an amorphous caretaker category, with underwhelming performance, but that placement often does not match what interim officials are doing. This seminar will focus on temporary leaders in government and business, but use other sectors as relevant. Drawing on legal materials, social science research, business studies, historical examples, and guest speakers, it will explore the causes and consequences of interim leaders as well as the constraints under which they operate. The seminar will also consider how such leaders could be more effective and how interim officials can become more permanent leaders. Requirements will include multiple writing assignments (including short reading reflections and a 10-15 page paper on a relevant topic or interim leader).

        "title": "Thinking in Systems",
        "description": "Virtually every public policy has causes and consequences beyond those that are intended or immediately visible. This is true of criminal law policies that use algorithmic predictions of flight before trial; environmental policies involving greenhouse gas emissions and conventional pollutants; and social and health policies that address homelessness, institutional racism, and the distribution of Covid vaccines, to name just a few examples. The causes of the problems that these policies seek to address are complex. As a result, these policies often fail and sometimes have unintended adverse consequences.  &quot;Systems thinking&quot; is a framework that describes the web of associations in which such policies reside, with the goals of understanding the multiple causes of problems and designing policies that lead to stable, positive changes. Thinking in systems and learning to map systems, are core skills for policy makers.  After several introductory classes devoted to learning these concepts and learning how to use the web-based systems mapping tool, Kumu, students will work on systems design projects of their choice.

        "description": "Social media platforms are arguably the most important channels of communication in the modern world, but it's not always clear how existing legal frameworks apply to them--not to mention the proliferation of new laws attempting to rein platforms in. This course will explore the changing legal landscape governing platforms, and the role of the First Amendment in either constraining legal changes or being the vehicle through which such changes are made. We will explore topical and live legal issues in the platform regulation space, which may include section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, attempts to impose must-carry and common carrier obligations on platforms to carry certain speech, how the First Amendment constrains government actors on social media, the constitutionality of imposing transparency and due process requirements on platforms' content moderation practices, attempts to restrict minors' access to social media, or efforts to ban certain platforms altogether. Students will complete multiple short reflection papers throughout the quarter. Students may elect to write a substantial research paper for R-credit with instructor permission. Students taking the course for R-credit (Section 02) will receive 3 units. After the term begins, students enrolled in the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructors.

So too, cities present many of the most innovative, impactful solutions to these challenges.  In this seminar, we'll look at three great challenges that confront Americans--the dearth of affordable housing, the growing impacts of climate change, and violent crime--in the urban context.  We'll explore the legal, fiscal, and political limitations that constrain the terrain of local policymaking, and we will assess best practices among cities for enacting meaningful change within that landscape.  Readings and discussion will overwhelmingly focus on U.S. cities, but we will consider a few examples from abroad as well.  We will seek to move beyond familiar ideological battles to emphasize outcomes, evidence-based solutions, and analytical rigor.  From contemporary academic studies and journals, news articles, case law, and guest speakers, students will gain an appreciation for cities as policy laboratories for pragmatic solutions that often elude binary labelling as &quot;progressive&quot; or &quot;conservative.&quot;  Students will be better prepared to understand and engage in cities as civic leaders, legal advisors or adversaries, participants in economic transactions, and constituents.

        "title": "Political Violence and the Law",
        "description": "Twenty years after September 11, 2001, and the onset of the U.S.-led global war on terror, fears of political violence within the United States are rising and shifting.  Between the assault on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, record numbers of hate crimes targeting identity groups, and growing proportions of the American public expressing support for violence against the state, the specter of political violence has generated new legal questions and rekindled old ones.  How does the law conceptualize &quot;political&quot; crimes or &quot;crimes against the state&quot;?  What are the legal, political, and symbolic differences between categories such as treason, terrorism, insurrection, sedition, and hate crimes?  How does the law conceptualize such violence in comparison with violence by the state?  How should government institutions, including executive agencies and courts, respond to the threat of political violence while protecting rights, supporting equality, and aspiring to democratic accountability?  This seminar explores contemporary policy questions in light of a broader theoretical, historical, and legal context.  This course has two grading options.  You may either choose to complete four response papers (4-5 pages each) responding to the week's readings or write a 18-20 page research paper for R credit.  Elements used in grading: Attendance, class participation, and written assignments or a final research paper.",

They seek to detect and deter waste, fraud, and abuse in government operations, and improve their efficiency and effectiveness. They provide an independent check on government and hold powerful government officials accountable. This seminar will explore the crucial oversight role and responsibilities of inspectors general and other government oversight entities. Students will examine the history of inspectors general, their responsibilities, their legal authorities, their relationships with their agencies and other government oversight entities, and the need to strengthen and reform our system of government oversight. Students will also discuss whether the federal judiciary needs an inspector general.  In the winter quarter, the seminar will meet on Wednesdays from 4:15 to 6:15. The first hour of most sessions will involve a discussion of the week's topic. In the second hour, students will often hear from a speaker, including current and former inspectors general and leaders of oversight organizations, about the issues they faced as well as the satisfactions and challenges of public service.  Most speakers will participate remotely.  Students will be expected to submit questions for the speaker in advance, based on the week's reading, and students will have an opportunity to ask the speaker their questions or other questions.  Elements used in grading include attendance and class participation, questions submitted for the speaker, and a final paper.",

Many traditional sources of news are struggling to stay viable and cutting staff, while new sources of news, including anyone with a twitter or Tik Tok account, proliferate -- with much consumer confusion about what sources are credible.  In this course we will cover a range of topics:  from  Johnny Depp's defamation case against Amber Heard; to Elon Musk and the tweets that prompted the SEC to file suit; to the Pentagon papers and The Washington Post and more.

        "description": "We will take a &quot;deep dive&quot; into some of the most interesting and contentious issues in the &quot;federal courts&quot; space.  Illustrative topics might include any or all of the following:  (1) Jurisdiction-stripping (Can Congress eliminate the Supreme Court's jurisdiction to hear certain types of cases, and if so, under what circumstances?); (2) Standing doctrine (Is the &quot;injury-in-fact&quot; requirement made up, and might there be a better way to think about the case-or-controversy requirement?); (3) Habeas corpus (What role should innocence play?); (4) Eleventh Amendment (What should we do when constitutional text and history seem to point in different directions?); and (5) Qualified immunity (Where did it come from, what are the relevant policy justifications and critiques, and can current doctrine be squared with 42 U.S.C. 1983's plain language?).  Readings will include judicial opinions and journal articles.  We will aim to tackle one topic per session.  Judge Newsom will introduce the topic and lead the discussion, and he will encourage vigorous classroom discussion.  Grading: Students will write a short &quot;thought piece&quot; (NOT a research paper), due by the end of the fall quarter (NOT at the end of the two-week class period).  Students are encouraged--but by no means required--to consider turning their thought pieces into more substantial written works for publication.

        "description": "In virtually every major U.S. city, the lack of affordable housing or homelessness (or both) constitutes the most urgent concern to residents.  Amid ample hang-wringing by politicians, pundits, and the press, the human toll of the housing affordability crises has only worsened.  This class will focus on solutions to this crisis.  Solutions abound, but implementing them at scale requires understanding--and navigating--the legal,  economic, and political constraints faced by decision makers.  It's in large cities where we see the problem most acutely, but where we also see America's most innovative solutions.  So, this class--taught by the former mayor of one of America's dozen largest cities-- will have a decidedly urban focus.  While the local entitlement and development process will provide a starting point, the class will also delve into key elements of state and federal policy and law that shape the local responses to these crises.  An eclectic set of sources --studies, court opinions, consultant reports, economic meta-analyses, news accounts and an occasional guest lecturer-- will support class discussion.  The class will be taught with a bias against the ideological, eschewing progressive or conservative &quot;quick fixes,&quot; and emphasizing problem-solving, pragmatism, an openness to opposing viewpoints, and a willingness to acknowledge the trade-offs in every approach.  Students will be expected to persuasively advocate for specific solutions--in class discussion and in writing-- and to demonstrate an understanding of the limitations of those solutions. Elements used in grading:  Class Participation, Written Assignments.  This class is limited to 35 students, with an effort made to have students from SLS (25 students by lottery) and up to 10 non-law students with consent of the instructor.  Law students may bid for LAW 7128 via the Law Lottery in Axess.  Non-law students may enroll in PUBLPOL 171 up to a maximum of 10 with consent of the instructor.

        "description": "In this class, we will survey the current state of the science of behavior change.  By the 1990s, social scientists had already built a massive literature on this topic, and an integrative consensus theoretical framework began to emerge.  But in the past decade, this literature has been revitalized by dramatic new ideas and technologies, as well as significant improvements in evaluation methodology.  We will focus on four types of strategies that apply equally to influence efforts by individuals, communities, non-profits, for-profits, and government: (1) Carrots: Positive incentives (rewards, awards, praise, recognition, discounts, rebates, property rights, etc.); (2) Sticks: Negative incentives (punishments, fines, shaming, guilt or liability verdicts, costs, etc.); (3) Norms: What other people believe I should do, and what I see others actually do (tipping points, bandwagons, cascades, herding, etc.); and (4) Nudges: Traditional methods of persuasion; use of defaults to encourage certain behaviors; engineering the environment; harm reduction for risky behaviors.  We will examine the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; and &quot;when&quot; of these approaches, but also their normative implications for ethics, justice, and public welfare.  Course requirements include class attendance and participation, and five short written assignments. For Research &quot;R&quot; credit, students may petition to complete one long paper based on independent research.

        "description": "This course will provide a broad overview of the scholarly field known as &quot;law and economics.&quot; The focus will be on how legal rules and institutions can correct market failures. We will discuss the economic function of contracts and, when contracts fail or are not feasible, the role of legal remedies to resolve disputes. We will also discuss at some length the choice between encouraging private parties to initiate legal actions to correct externalities and governmental actors, such as regulatory authorities. Extensive attention will be given to the economics of litigation, and to how private incentives to bring lawsuits differ from the social value of litigation. The economic motive to commit crimes, and the optimal governmental response to crime, will be studied in depth. Specific topics within the preceding broad themes include: the Coase Theorem; the tradeoff between the certainty and severity of punishment; the choice between ex ante and ex post sanctions; negligence versus strict liability; property rules; remedies for breach of contract; and the American rule versus the English rule for allocating litigation costs. There is no formal economics prerequisite to take this course, though some prior training in economics will be helpful. Elements used in grading: Final exam (open-book) plus three short take-home problems during the quarter. Cross-listed with Public Policy (PUBLPOL 302B).

After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. There is no formal economics prerequisite to take this seminar, though students doing the longer research papers typically have some prior training in economics. Students may take both Law and Economics Seminar I and Law and Economics Seminar II in either order (neither is a prerequisite for the other). This seminar is cross-listed with the Economics Department (same as Econ 354). Elements used in grading: Four commentaries or one research paper. Special note: Professor Polinsky will be the principal instructor, with Professor Donohue participating mainly when there are guest speakers.

        "title": "Empirical Legal Studies: Research Design",
        "description": "Empirical legal studies have become trendy in the U.S. and are now spreading to law faculties in other countries as well. The popular image of an empirical study is that it involves sophisticated statistical analysis of quantitative data. Often the author of the study starts with a handy dataset and then tries to figure out what question he or she can answer using those data.  Useful empirical studies of law and other topics don't start this way. Instead the researcher has a question, derived from theoretical literature or policy debate (or both) and faces the challenge of deciding what types of empirical data, collected and analyzed in what fashion, will best answer that question. The possibilities range from &quot;big data&quot; analyses of hundreds or thousands of documents, tweets or something similar to lengthy, intensive interviews with a few well-placed officials or informants, with just about any other way one might collect factual data --  e.g. online surveys, courtroom observations -- in between. What all of these approaches have in common is not that they involve numeric data but that they attempt to arrive at as objective a view of social, economic, or political reality as is possible.  Learning how to design and conduct a survey or how to estimate a regression model or apply AI to vast numbers of texts is (relatively speaking) easy. There are lots of courses at Stanford that you can take on these methods. Learning what approaches are most appropriate to answer the research questions you are interested in is much harder. This seminar is directed at helping you think through the design of an empirical research project -- whether quantitative, qualitative or both -- from identifying researchable questions to collecting and analyzing data to presenting your results to academic or policy audiences. You will start with a broad question (or several questions) of interest to you, based on your previous experience, other studies or reading. By the end of the seminar you will have identified questions you can investigate empirically (perhaps in addition to theoretically) and figured out what research approach(es) will work best for you. The product of the seminar will be a preliminary research proposal, whether for your master's thesis this year or some other purpose in the future.  Although plans for the fall quarter are still somewhat in flux, I expect to teach this seminar online with the assistance of the SPILS teaching fellow. I hope it will be possible to meet in person at the beginning of the quarter for a few introductory sessions to begin to get to know each other. In any event, I will be available throughout the quarter for one-on-one zoom sessions to discuss your research.  Special Instructions: JD students can take the class with consent of the instructor.  After the term begins, JD students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which can potentially satisfy the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Consent Application for JD students: To apply for this course, JD students must e-mail the instructors for permission to enroll.  This course is REQUIRED for all SPILS fellows and BY CONSENT for all other students. Interested students should email the instructor for consent to enroll.

        "description": "Drawing inferences from quantitative data lies at the heart of many legal and policy decisions. This course provides the tools, concepts, and framework for lawyers to become sophisticated consumers of quantitative evidence and social science. The course will begin with an overview of basic statistical concepts that will bring everyone to the point where they can read and evaluate empirical studies. We will then focus on a number of empirical debates -- for example, does the death penalty deter murder, do concealed handgun laws influence crime -- as a springboard to teach the logic and terminology of statistical/econometric evaluation of law and policy (regression, statistical significance, identification). No background, beyond high school algebra, is assumed. Anyone who 1) will work in litigation (whether corporate, securities, antitrust, employment discrimination, environmental law) or in public policy, 2) wants to be a better citizen or 3) wants to understand the challenges of establishing causal relationships, and who doesn't already have a strong understanding of statistics will find this course useful. Elements Used in Grading: Attendance, written and oral assignments, response papers, and a final project. To avoid math phobias and fears about ringers from the econ or stats departments, the course is graded as a mandatory pass-fail course.",

        "description": "This a one-unit, Law Mandatory P/R/F course that grows out of the recommendations of the 2018 Faculty and Student Working Group on Diversity and Inclusion.  The course is built around a series of outside speakers on identity and prejudice.  These speakers will include the sociologist Lawrence Bobo (W.E.B. Du Bois Professor of Social Sciences at Harvard) and the psychologist Mahzarin Benaji (Richard Clark Cabot Professor of Social Ethics at Harvard).  The lectures will be open to all members of the Stanford community.  Students who wish to get course credit will be required to attend the lectures, participate in faculty and student-led discussions and write reflection papers.  The course consists of 10 hours of lecture and discussion.  The course is formally offered in the Spring Quarter, 2019 and credit for the course will be given at that time.  However, the lectures and discussions will take place throughout the school year.  The first of the lectures will take place on Wednesday, October 31 at 4 pm.  Students unable to attend the lecture on October 31 may still participate in the upcoming lectures to be announced.  Students who wish to take the course should sign up now so as to be notified of the time of the lectures and discussion sessions.  Students with questions about the course should email Joseph Bankman at jbankman@stanford.edu.  Begin in Autumn Quarter and run through Spring Quarter.

        "description": "Empirical Legal Studies uses data to inform legal and policy debates. Traditional empirical legal scholarship uses methods such as observational studies and experiments to examine the effects of various policies or legal decisions. More recently, advancements in technology have given rise to a new strand of research that uses tools such as machine learning and natural language processing to study legally relevant datasets at a large scale (&quot;Big Data&quot;). This seminar will present a range of topics that highlight current empirical legal scholarship in these areas. A theme of the course will be comparing and contrasting traditional empirical approaches with the techniques emerging from machine learning and big data.  During roughly half of the sessions, we will host a guest speaker who will present an ongoing empirical research project. Familiarity with data science or statistics is not required.  Special Instructions: You may write a series of short commentaries on the guest speakers' papers, of which there will be four. Students electing this option will be graded on a Mandatory Pass/Restricted Credit/Fail basis and receive 2 units of credit. Alternatively, you may write a single empirical research paper on a legal topic of your choice. This will satisfy the Law School's Research requirement. These papers will be graded on an Honors/Pass/Restricted Credit/Fail basis.  Students taking the seminar for R credit can take the seminar for either 2 or 3 units of credit (section 02), depending on the project. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. There is no formal prerequisite to take this seminar, though students doing the longer research papers typically have some prior training in statistics.

        "description": "Many legal and policy debates rest on central claims that are either true or false. Does hiring more police officers reduce crime? Does increasing the minimum wage lead to reduced employment? Do risk assessment tools help judges identify defendants with a high recidivism risk? Most of these questions have been studied extensively, but the findings are often conflicting, making it difficult to identify effective solutions to pressing, societal problems.  This course is designed to help students evaluate empirical research findings and to distinguish studies that are credible from those that are less credible. We will spend a significant amount of time understanding the markers of strong research designs and how to communicate findings transparently and effectively.  The course focuses exclusively on the concepts underlying (social) scientific research, not their inner machinations. Among others, this means that mathematical / statistical training is neither required nor acquired during the course. Everything we will cover will be based on plain language and intuitive, visual aids like figures and charts. Still, those with extensive technical training will sometimes have spent significant time thinking through difficult concepts like causality. To avoid the impact of potential discrepancies in student preparedness, the course is graded as a mandatory pass-fail course.

        "description": "The emergence of the &quot;multi-door&quot; courthouse and the rapid growth of private alternative dispute resolution (ADR) providers has re-shaped the litigation landscape.  Today, civil litigators face &quot;process pluralism&quot; both in our courts and the private sector in which lawyers represent clients in arbitrations, mediations, and a broad range of hybrid processes.  This course seeks to provide students with an overview of the policies, options, and strategies confronting lawyers as society increasingly turns to alternative forms of dispute resolution.  The growth of ADR processes reflects its perceived benefits to parties, by comparison to court-based adjudication.  In this seminar we will take a critical look at both arbitration and mediation.  The goal is for you to understand the law and policy behind these alternatives and to be able to provide effective counseling and representation in ADR processes.  We will learn about the public and private law that governs arbitration and mediation agreements and proceedings; discuss how these processes &quot;work&quot; in resolving actual disputes; and consider the controversies that have arisen in recent years over the use of ADR in different contexts.

This course offers a space and time for each student to consider both through course materials, class interactions, and a series of reflection papers. The course includes one class facilitated in collaboration with the Office of Career Services focusing on a formal assessment via one or more psychological tests offered to each student. The materials for other class meetings are thought provoking works that have proven to be salient for considering career and life direction. Images and material from alchemy that embody what many consider to be a primary set of symbols for personal transformation provide a backdrop for the course.  The course benefits from the collaboration of Michael Guasperini, a mythologist and lawyer whose primary vocation is working intimately with lawyers and firms during periods of personal and institutional transition. Mr. Guasperini has deep experience with the personal lives of hundreds of lawyers at various ages and levels of professional development, providing a valuable and practical perspective for self-reflection.

        "title": "Redesigning Dispute Systems",
        "description": "Lawyers are often called upon to apply their creative skills to help design systems (comprised of one or more processes) for preventing, managing, and resolving conflicts. Examples span many domains: 1. what combination of international and domestic processes would facilitate cross-border e-commerce and protect consumers? Who should decide--consumer protection agencies? Merchants? Consumers? 2. a corporate general counsel and the director of human resources are tasked by senior management with proposing ways to decrease the number of employee disputes and reduce turnover; 3. in the era of the COVID pandemic, courts have been called upon to continue service to the public using online resources, yet maintain due process and just outcomes; 4. San Francisco Human Rights Commission has formed an African American Reparations Advisory Committee to make recommendations to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. In each example, a lawyer, businessperson, nonprofit manager, or public official (working alone or with others) must address not just a single dispute but a stream of disputes over time. Lawyers often lead the design, redesign and implementation of these conflict resolution systems. Increasingly these systems utilize technology to improve efficiency, accessibility, and transparency for disputants. In this class we will apply an analytic framework (including stakeholder assessment and conflict resolution process options) to a series of case studies and use simulations to understand different kinds of dispute systems. We will also examine the growing use of online dispute resolution (ODR), the new challenges it poses to neutrals and system designers, and evolving best practices for the use of technology in dispute system design. Special Instructions: Grades will be based on class participation and Option 1 (section 01) a series of weekly short written assignments plus a 10-page case study; or Option 2 (section 02) weekly short written assignments plus a 26-page research paper involving independent research. Students electing option 2 (section 02) will be graded on the H/P/R/F system and will receive Research (R) credit. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Negotiation Seminar (LAW 7821) is preferred but not required. Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance, written assignments, and final paper.

        "description": "Most lawyers and other professionals spend a significant amount of time in meetings and working in teams or groups for a variety of purposes, and many report that this can be a frustrating experience. As the practice of law becomes more complex, it includes more and more situations where groups of people need to work together planning complex legal strategies, developing firm policies, working with corporations or other multi-person clients, or participating in shareholder meetings, public commissions and councils, corporate and non-profit board of directors meetings. Group functionality and outcomes can be significantly improved by any group member who has the awareness and skills of a facilitator, whether or not that person is formally designated as the facilitator. The interactive class methodology will combine discussion with many exercises and roleplays, putting facilitation tools into practice every step of the way. We will examine group dynamics and learn skills used by professional facilitators to prevent common problems and elicit the best work of a group. We will explore how to prepare effectively with clear goals, collaborative problem definition, inclusive process design and a well-structured agenda. We will also discuss and practice core meeting management skills such as how to balance voice and participation, build consensus, inspire creativity and promote principled evaluation and decision-making. Finally, we will identify and apply communication skills that keep group sessions productive, and tools to manage difficult moments and problem behaviors.

Students should acquire a solid knowledge of research tools and a frame of reference that enables them to function independently and competently in the complex world of legal information. Students will accomplish the following learning objectives: 1) Develop and apply tailored research strategies for common and novel legal research problems; 2) Locate, evaluate, and apply relevant and up-to-date secondary sources and primary authority to legal problems; 3) Strategically use available and developing research tools to increase research efficiency; 4) Build and maintain a research process that incorporates metacognitive practices. Learning legal research requires a hands-on approach, so students will complete in-class exercises, homework assignments, and a final research hypothetical -- all of which contribute to grading.

        "description": "This course aims to prepare law students for research in litigation practice and judicial clerkships. More broadly, the primary goal is to enable students, now and later in their professional lives, to map out a coherent plan of action when asked to research a topic previously unfamiliar to them.  Students should acquire a solid knowledge of research tools and a frame of reference that enables them to function independently and competently in the complex world of legal information.  Students will accomplish the following learning objectives: (1) demonstrate, analyze, and execute common research strategies and processes related to legal research, and habitually assess your research strategies and processes as you research; (2) develop an understanding of and approach to researching common litigation research questions; and (3) find, evaluate, and use legal research materials, including different types of secondary sources and primary sources, to answer general and specific research questions. Learning legal research requires a hands-on approach, so students will complete in-class exercises, homework assignments, and a final research hypothetical -- all of which contribute to grading. There will not be a final exam. This course is open to Stanford graduate students with permission from the instructors.",

        "title": "Mediation",
        "description": "As law is practiced today, attorneys are far more likely to participate in multiple mediations than trial. Mediation has become the preferred approach to conflict resolution in most states and many parts of the world. With the assistance of a mediator, parties can reach agreements at any stage in a dispute, in some cases avoiding litigation altogether, in other cases agreeing just before trial or when the case is on appeal. The course goals are to understand the nature of conflict and principles of conflict management, to develop the oral and written communication skills essential to effective mediation, to evaluate various mediation models and mediator styles, to practice all of the phases of a mediation and appropriate use of caucus, to consider the policy and ethical implications of the expanding use of mediation, and to develop the skills necessary to represent clients in mediation. The class methodology is highly experiential, with more than half of the class consisting of practice from the perspective of client, advocate and mediator. The course also includes readings and discussions, brief interactive lectures, demonstrations and videotaped sessions. Each student receives individual feedback from an experienced Bay Area mediator and develops skills that will be useful in client development, interviewing, counseling, fact development and legal analysis, negotiation and a variety of contexts beyond mediation. You are encouraged to apply if you have taken (or are concurrently taking) the basic negotiation class or its equivalent in studies or experience. Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance at all classes, and assignments. CONSENT APPLICATION: To apply for this course, students must complete and submit a Consent Application Form available on the SLS website (Click Courses at the bottom of the homepage and then click Consent of Instructor Forms).

        "title": "Moot Court",
        "description": "The major moot court activity at Stanford Law School is the Marion Rice Kirkwood Memorial Competition, which takes place each year during Autumn and Winter Terms and gives students the opportunity to brief and argue an actual case before a hypothetical U.S. Supreme Court. This course is designed to facilitate the administration of the Competition and is not intended to be an advanced legal writing class. It does not meet regularly and students are expected to operate independently.  Autumn term is dedicated to brief writing and completion of the written portion of the Competition; the oral argument portion of the Competition is conducted during the first four to five weeks of Winter term. Students on externship and in clinics may enroll, if permitted by their respective programs.  In Autumn term there are two class meetings--one which provides an overview of the Competition and another which provides an overview of brief writing in the U.S. Supreme Court. In addition, there are individually scheduled conferences. The first draft of the brief is reviewed and extensively critiqued by the course instructors. The course instructors and the Moot Court Board Presidents score the final draft of the brief.  In Winter term, there are two class meetings, one which provides guidance on oral advocacy techniques and another which is a lecture by a practitioner involved in that year's case. In addition, there are optional practice arguments with the instructors and Moot Court Board Members, which are recorded and critiqued. Participation in the oral argument competition is mandatory and includes attendance at the semifinal and final arguments. The preliminary and quarterfinal rounds are held in the evening; the semifinal and final rounds are in the late afternoon. Panels of judges and local attorneys serve as judges who score the oral argument portion of the Competition.  Registration for the Kirkwood Competition is by team. Each team is required to submit an appellate brief of substantial length and quality and to complete at least two oral arguments, one on each side of that year's case.  Teams are selected for the quarterfinal, semifinal, and final round of the Competition based on their brief and oral advocacy scores. The final round of the Competition is held before a panel of distinguished judges, and the entire Law School community is invited to attend.  Special Instructions: To maintain academic standards, enrollment in the Kirkwood Competition is limited to 20 two-person teams. This limit will be strictly enforced. Registration forms will be distributed Spring term. If the program is oversubscribed, a lottery will be held to determine participating teams and to establish a waiting list. Priority is given to third-year students; however, several spots are reserved for second-year teams. The final drop deadline for the course will be on Thursday of the first week of classes. Enrollment in both Autumn (2 units) and Winter (1 unit) terms is required. The final grade for both Autumn and Winter terms and the Professional Skills credit will be awarded upon the completion of the course requirements.  Registration and Consent Instructions: Instructions on how to register for the Moot Court Competition are sent out to students each year in Spring term for the coming academic year. The registration process is separate from the regular class registration process. Early application and drop deadlines.",

        "title": "Negotiation",
        "description": "As a lawyer, you will probably negotiate more than you do anything else. You will negotiate not just over cases, but any time that you need something that you cannot get alone. You will negotiate with your boss, your clients, your paralegal, and all of their counterparts (plus the lawyers) on the other side. You will negotiate with &quot;the system&quot; whether it is the court, the government, the structure of society, or the law. You will also continue to negotiate with your family, your friends, and yourself. This course is designed to: (1) develop your understanding of negotiation, and your awareness of yourself as a negotiator; (2) give you some tools and concepts for analyzing and preparing for negotiations; (3) enhance your negotiating skills through frequent role plays, reflection, and feedback; and (4) teach you how to keep learning from your own negotiation experience. In addition to negotiation skills and theory (including interviewing, counseling, negotiation, fact analysis, legal analysis, and collaboration), you will be introduced to issues of representation, ethics, and the place of negotiation in our legal system. The Negotiation Seminar is an intense, interactive course. We will require weekly preparation of readings, simulations, and written assignments. Basically, you will learn by reading about specific research and doing simulated negotiations -- figuring out with the rest of the class what works and what does not, writing about what you're learning, and trying again. Because participation in the simulations is central to the course, attendance at all classes is required. Since we will begin our simulation exercises on the first day of class, all students who are interested in taking the course (whether enrolled or on the wait-list) need to be present for the first class. (Students who are not present will be dropped from the class or waiting list unless they have made previous arrangements with the instructor.) Add-drop decisions need to be resolved at the first class. Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance and written assignments.  There is a mandatory class on Friday afternoon, (TBA).",

Through experience-based learning, simulations, guest speakers and case studies the course will expose students to various types of international conflict resolution processes, including natural resource management and extractive industries, human rights protection, ceasefire negotiations, and peace agreements. Students will strengthen their written and oral skills, counseling, factual and legal analysis. Special attention will be paid to the role of mediators and facilitators in such processes. Prerequisites: Negotiation Seminar, its academic equivalent, or experience in the field.  Students who have not fulfilled these prerequisites may still be admitted to the class, but required to attend a bootcamp in basic negotiation theory and methods on Saturday, April 2nd.  Please describe prior negotiations coursework and experience on your Consent Form.  SPILS students are especially encouraged to enroll. This course is also open to cross-registration by graduate students in a variety of departments and programs including International Policy Studies.  Grading Criteria: The seminar requires that students attend all classes, do the assigned reading, prepare for and actively participate in class and simulations, and write a series of short assignments.

        "title": "Advanced Negotiation: Public Policy",
        "description": "Advanced Negotiation courses are designed to take students beyond the two-party, lawyer-client negotiations that were the focus of the Negotiation Seminar, to examine many facets of negotiation complexity, both in terms of the participants and topics. This section of Advanced Negotiation will focus on multi-party negotiations, working in teams, group decision-making, and negotiating on behalf of organizations to solve complex problems, specifically when there are divided communities. We will study negotiations and stakeholder dialogue processes involving a diverse set of public and private actors. In the context of both real and simulated case studies, we will address diverse public policy issues, including civil rights, racial justice, economic inequality and natural resources management. Civil unrest as experienced recently in police-community conflicts -- such as Ferguson and Baltimore as well as in the Occupy Movement -- increase polarization among groups of residents in ways not seen in decades. The unrest sometimes produces positive results. In many instances, participants experience the divisions as intense and pervasive, yet remain optimistic that they can be resolved. These deep divisions pose significant challenges to the integrity of our democratic society and can quickly escalate to bitter contests, leaving fissures within communities for decades, and possibly resulting in major economic damage and even loss of life. The goals of the class are twofold, for students (1) to acquire an added theoretical base beyond what was covered in the Negotiation Seminar through which to analyze, prepare for, participate in and facilitate more complex, multiparty negotiations, and (2) to expand skills through deeper examination of various actual negotiation cases and complex simulations. Special Instructions: Attendance at and participation in the simulations is required. Passing is dependent upon active participation, submission of several assigned short reflection papers, and completion of a substantial group paper and presentation analyzing a selected case (a completed or ongoing multi-party public policy dialogue) and the team's internal negotiation process. Prerequisite: Negotiation Seminar (Law 7821) or its substantial equivalent.  Elements used in grading: Class participation and engagement, including simulations; attendance; preparation for and contributions to discussion; short written assignments; final project involving group and individual components.",

        "description": "Advanced Negotiation takes students beyond the two-party, lawyer-client negotiations that were the focus of the Negotiation Seminar. The negotiation simulations are more complex, difficult and nuanced, and preparation time is significant. You will work as an individual lawyer or businessperson, in a lawyer-client pairing, or on a business negotiation team. You may be negotiating on behalf of corporate entities large and small, national governments, municipalities, unions and NGOs. Simulations may include critical-path supply agreements, founder/VC deals, cross-cultural medical device joint ventures, airline reorganization, big pharma global distribution deals, or multi-party private sector/government negotiations. The goals of the class emanate from developing your designer's mindset and a lawyer's instinct for effective, self-interested negotiation: from intense preparation for client counseling, to in-the-moment tactics; adroit response to changing scenarios; deeper work on persuasion, listening, question &amp; answer management; structural design &amp; process control and, ultimately, creating an intact confidence--competence feedback loop for the student qua professional negotiator. Special Instructions: Attendance and participation in all simulations and debriefing sessions are required, absent approved absence (rarely given) with ample advance notice to the instructor. A &quot;Pass&quot; grade is dependent upon this active participation, and a series of short papers and/or in-class presentations. Prerequisite: Negotiation Seminar or its substantial equivalent, as assessed by the instructor.

The instructor will provide the written briefs, and each week half the class will argue and half the class will judge a motion. Preparation will require reading the cases cited in the briefs and coming to class ready either to present an argument (attorneys) or interrogate counsel (judges). Students will critique each other both orally and in writing, and the instructor will provide oral critiques of all arguments. The goals of this class are: to train students to argue in court; to provide them with a chance to polish their public speaking skills and practice thinking on their feet; to prepare students to engage in challenging dialogue with both colleagues and future clients; and to improve self-confidence. Thus, while the context of the course is litigation, the objectives are much broader than the mastery of litigation technique. This course is not open to first year Law School students. LLM students may enroll if they have familiarity with U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Priority will be given to those students who commit to taking the class (i.e., actually taking the class, barring unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances) if given consent to enroll.

        "title": "Trial Advocacy Workshop",
        "description": "This lawyering skills course gives students an orientation to and constant practice in most basic pretrial and trial advocacy skills areas. Topics include: taking and defending depositions, trial evidence, including admission of trial exhibits in evidence and use of prior witness statements to refresh and impeach a witness, jury selection and voir dire, opening statements, direct and cross-examination of witnesses, and closing arguments. Students will try a full jury case through to verdict with use of jurors and usually before a real judge in the courthouse in Palo Alto at the end of the course. Students will also have a chance to watch the jurors deliberate and talk with them after their verdict. The course takes place during eight weeks of the Autumn Quarter with two classes (one lecture and one workshop) per week on most weeks from 4:15-9:00 PM, plus the final weekend of jury trials, Saturday and Sunday, November 11 and 12. Each day's ending time will vary; most sessions will end before 9:00 PM. For details, please refer to the 2023 Trial Advocacy Workshop Schedule at https://bit.ly/3NJA7DS. The format for each topic begins with a lecture/discussion featuring video vignettes of various techniques and a live demonstration by an expert trial lawyer. Following the discussion portion of each topic are small group sessions during which each student practices the skills involved. Constructive feedback is given after each exercise by two of our faculty of very experienced Bay Area litigators and judges. Most exercises are also videoed for further one-on-one critique by another faculty member. The central philosophy of the workshop is that skills are best acquired in an experiential manner by seeing and doing. Frequent short, well-defined exercises followed by immediate constructive feedback in a non-competitive, non-threatening atmosphere provide the core of the program. The workshop directors are Judge Sallie Kim, Sara Peters, and Traci Owens. Sallie is a United States Magistrate Judge in San Francisco and was a partner in a civil litigation firm and also previously taught a class at SLS and served as Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Sara is a trial attorney for a personal injury law firm in San Francisco. She graduated from Stanford Law School in 2008 and coaches the Stanford Law School mock trial team. Traci has 23 years of trial experience. She has participated as an instructor in the Stanford Law School Trial Advocacy program for more than a decade, and she taught in a similar program at Santa Clara University School of Law for more than fifteen years.  Special Instructions: If you haven't taken Evidence, you must contact Judge Kim before the course begins for some brief pre-course reading assignments. There are no papers or tests, but attendance at every session is required. Since we will begin our trial advocacy exercises on the first day of class, all students who are interested in taking the course (whether enrolled or on the wait-list) need to be present for the first class. (Students who are not present will be dropped from the class or waiting list unless they have made previous arrangements with the professor.) Add-drop decisions need to be resolved at the first class; no drops will be permitted thereafter. Exceptions to this rule will be made by petition only. Mandatory attendance. Elements used in grading: Attendance and in-class assignments. In addition, the Trial Advocacy Workshop is approved to offer Experiential Learning (EL) Credit.  CONSENT APPLICATION: To apply for this course, students must complete and submit a Consent Application Form available on the SLS Registrar website https://registrar.law.stanford.edu/.  Click SUNetID Login in the top right corner of the page and then click the &quot;Consent Courses&quot; tab.  See Consent Application Form for instructions and submission deadline.

With an emphasis on speaking and listening comprehension through in-class partner activities and dialogue, the class will teach students how to interact with clients who possess limited English proficiency. Students will also be given reading and listening homework assignments to help better their command of the Spanish language. Class instruction will take place principally in the Spanish language. The course is designed to be beneficial for students with varying levels of Spanish language ability, up to and including students who are native speakers of Spanish. The level of difficulty of the course presupposes that students have an intermediate level of Spanish, which includes an understanding of the essentials of Spanish grammar and ability to engage in intermediate conversation. Elements used in grading are attendance and class participation.  Please note, this class will expose students to emotionally complex and sensitive scenarios.",

        "description": "This course will give students intensive practice with legal analysis, argument structure, and writing in the appellate context. Through a combination of lectures, discussions, selected readings, and writing exercises, we will cover the most important components of appellate writing. The Lecturer will bring her practical experience in legal writing -- both as outside counsel at a law firm and in-house counsel at a high-growth tech company -- to bear as we work together towards each student crafting an appellate brief. The goals of this class are to deepen students' understanding of how to make compelling written arguments and to practice doing so in the context of an appeal on a cutting-edge issue. While this course will be focused on writing an appellate brief, the skills learned will be useful for all legal writing in a litigation context.

Lawyers and clients representing public interests have difficulty prevailing even when their fact patterns are sympathetic, often because the law is either undeveloped or unsupportive. Yet when public-interest litigation does succeed it can yield profound, positive change for underserved people and causes. This class will focus on the research and writing skills necessary to litigate public-interest lawsuits. The class will employ briefs from public- interest cases and other readings to unpack the rhetorical and analytical tools needed to persuade judges across the ideological spectrum. Students will also learn how to conduct advanced legal research; develop tools for interpreting and applying a wide variety of legal authorities; and hone their ability to be clear and creative. Students will practice the skills they learn by preparing multiple drafts of two pleadings in a single case, and will receive detailed feedback on their writing from the instructor and their peers. Grading will be based on a Mandatory P/R/F system, taking into account writing as well as class participation. Early drop deadline: Students may not drop this course after first week of class.

        "description": "This class engages students in participatory/collaborative approaches to redesign complex systems. They will answer the question: how do we make our social legal systems better for people -- and how do we put people at the center of this redesign? The seminar has two parallel components: (1) Learn from a series of experts who have been taking a community-led approach to remaking a legal system (or analogous ones). Guest experts will present their current case studies to illustrate strategy and process design. (2) Select one of two system redesign challenges (see below) and develop their own prototype launching workshop.  [For those students interested in continuing with the project, there will be a companion policy lab in the Spring Quarter 2018. This seminar is a prerequesite for the policy lab.] The two prospective system-leader partners are on the verge of major new overhauls of their current systems: (a) California Self-Help Services' guardianship/kid's custody redesign, with Bonnie Hough and the California Judicial Council as a partner, as they try to figure out how to remake the legal system for parents and family members (without lawyers) trying to get custody worked out for kids. (b) New York Chief Justice Task Force housing court/eviction redesign, with the Chief Judge Janet DiFiore's task force as the partner, as they try to figure out how to make the eviction system work better for users.  Students will develop their own preliminary plan and prototype for a user-centered process for their partner. Students will learn about new approaches to policy-change, as well as the fundamentals of participatory design and community lawyering. They will operationalize these different approaches, to make them relevant and actionable in an actual legal system. They must synthesize a recommendation to their partner-leader about how they might create a better process to redesign a given court process/system. And they must create a prototype of a launching workshop, that can demonstrate how a wider process would work, while also testing their plan.

        "description": "This one-credit course supports students undertaking public policy analysis projects in the Policy Lab and in other policy-based courses. The course helps students gain facility with basic policy methods and approaches common to Policy Lab practicums. The core session of the course consists of six hours of classroom instruction on a (typically the Saturday at the end of the first week of classes). The morning session emphasizes thinking like a policy analyst (as distinguished from an advocate or lawyer), scoping policy problems, promoting and assessing evidence quality, and making valid (and avoiding invalid) inferences. Students apply learning in a team-based simulation exercise on a topical policy issue.  The afternoon session introduces strategies for social change, including designing and evaluating programs that improve individual lives.  The immersive exercise typically focuses on developing and evaluating a program to reduce childhood obesity.  The course then offers a series of short workshops: (1) interviewing policy clients and other stakeholders (especially where ethnic and cultural differences may be salient), (2) policy research tools and strategies, (3) design thinking for law and policy, (4) systems thinking, (5) resources and methods for cultural competencies, and (6) policy writing. Students should attend at least three of the six workshops to receive credit for the course.  With guidance from their faculty instructors, students may then draw on the skills developed in this introductory seminar to analyze a public policy problem, develop potential strategies to address it, weigh the pros and cons of strategy options, and produce a final product that may offer options or recommendations to a policy client, suggestions for implementing such recommendations, and techniques to assess the effectiveness of implementation.  Note that the students who enroll in a Law and Policy Lab practicum for the first time are asked to participate in the full-day methods bootcamp whether or not they undertake Elements of Policy Analysis for course credit.

        "description": "This course explores and investigates the theory and practice of disciplined nonviolence in the Gandhi-King tradition to powerfully confront, transform and overcome injustice and systemic violence in divided communities.  We will examine the role of nonviolent direct action, negotiation and mediation in a variety of historical, present-day and simulated cases in order to identify and analyze strategic lessons from successes as well as failures.  We will inquire into the relationship between direct action campaigns, and legal processes and political decision-making.  After examining transformative campaigns led by Gandhi, King, and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, we will explore case studies such as the anti-apartheid movement, and truth and reconciliation process, in South Africa; and racial and environmental justice movements and anti-gun violence campaigns in the United States in recent years until the present day, including Black Lives Matter, March for Our Lives, and the fossil fuel divestiture movement.  Students will participate in several simulated negotiation and mediation exercises to develop experiential learning in the field from the perspective of multiple stakeholders, including activists, community leaders and government officials.  In several sessions we will engage in dialogue with leading scholars and activists of transformative nonviolence, and we will engage together in a nonviolence training workshop.  Students will have an option to enroll in an R-paper section with the permission of the instructor.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.

        "description": "This course seeks to explore a simple question: what lies beyond graduation? Within that question are a myriad of complexities. What does it mean to be an associate or a partner in a law firm? Should I do litigation or transactional work, such as public finance, whatever that is? Should I become a prosecutor or a public defender or criminal defense attorney? Should I go in-house and in what size place? Should I leave the law behind and pursue business or other opportunities? Those are not the only questions. To add an overlay that we all must address directly or indirectly, how is my being a person of color relevant to my decision and my success? In a world in which diversity is said to matter, as a person who is not of color, should I take that into account? What about being a woman or LGBTQ in the workplace? Or, what about being a woman or man who wishes to have a family? How does that (or should that) impact my decision? These are just some of the issues that will be explored. They will be explored each week in classes lead by different guests who will be law school graduates practicing law at law firms as associates and partners, practicing as prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers, in-house counsel, counsel for start-ups, and law school graduates who have left the law. The course will require the writing of a paper and grades will also depend on class attendance.  Attendance, Class Participation, Final Paper.",

        "description": "Mediation skills are invaluable to success in everything from negotiating commercial transactions to family interactions.  Lawyers mediate most litigated cases, even those never filed in court.  Do you want to be in the majority of people who constantly mediate, but never take a single mediation course? This course is a quick immersion in mediation advocacy, and mediation. It is intended for those who want to avoid being entirely unprepared for an essential part of legal practice and life. It is also intended for those who want to take a first step to see if mediation interests them. The two days of class will be an interactive exploration of the strategies, tactics and theories of mediation, and mediation advocacy. Class will include: 1) a concise overview of mediation approaches and theories, 2) skills exercises, 3) multiple mediation role plays, and 4) individualized video review. Together these will allow students to think about, practice, and experiment with, the most effective approaches to mediation advocacy and mediation. The course will be taught by Michael E. Dickstein, a full-time mediator of complex cases across the U.S. and Canada for more than twenty years, and a former partner in a leading law firm. Elements used in grading: Attendance, Class Participation, and Video Review. In Winter Quarter, this class will meet Friday February 23, 3:00PM-7:30PM and Saturday February 24, 9:30AM-5:30 PM.

        "description": "This is a practice-based, skills-building class requiring students to draft, edit, and negotiate a complex technology agreement. Using a biotechnology case as context, the curriculum is designed to translate contract principles and doctrine (to which students have been exposed,) into real-world practice. Students will acquire the foundational tools necessary to write clear, effective, plain-language provisions into agreements that memorialize a bargain between parties based on realistic situations. Exercises include simulations in which students will draft, edit, and negotiate sections of agreements.  Students will also be expected to show an understanding of what it means to develop, foster, and sustain client trust, advocate in a client's best interests, as well as effectively and ethically engage with a counter-party's counsel. Students will function as senior associates in a law firm, or as in-house counsel tasked with managing licensing and commercial transactions for a technology developer. A focus will be placed on understanding client's needs versus wants, as well as modes of supporting clients to achieve their goals while identifying, counseling, and mitigating legal risk. Exercises are designed to help students improve their critical thinking, due diligence, analysis, drafting, and editing skills, which deepens an understanding as to the expectations of attorneys and clients with whom they will be working and supporting respectively. Grades will be based heavily on class participation, skills built in simulated negotiations, as well as drafting exercises weighted by level of complexity. Students may elect credit for either experiential learning (EL) or professional writing (PW) for this course.  Prerequisite: Completed an Introductory level Intellectual Property class (LAW 4005).

        "description": "The seminar on corporate governance meets in the Autumn and Winter quarters and forms the core of the LL.M. Program in Corporate Governance &amp; Practice. The course, designed to be taken in conjunction with Corporations in Autumn, takes an economic approach to the analysis of corporate law. In particular, we ask why American corporate law has its particular structure. We will seek to understand how the separation of ownership and control produces agency costs, and the ways in which corporate law seeks to remedy these through techniques like disclosure, fiduciary duties, shareholder litigation, voting, and hostile takeovers. We will read and discuss ongoing debates among scholars and practitioners about the agency cost framework, the merits and limits of current legal policies, and the role of institutional arrangements like activist shareholders. We will also consider the relevance of these disputes, and the effectiveness of corporate law and governance more generally, in the context of a variety of real-life incidents. No knowledge of economics is presupposed, so the course will also introduce basic economics and finance concepts necessary to understand these concepts. Some course sessions will feature outside speakers who will complement the discussions with real-world examples drawn from practice. Attendance and active participation are important to the success of the seminar and an important factor in the overall grade. Students are expected to have carefully read and reviewed assigned materials in advance of each session. Students will be required to submit short reflection papers that evaluate, critique, and discuss some or all of the assigned readings. Students will also be asked to prepare presentations and case studies. The class will be graded H/P/R/F in Autumn Quarter and Winter Quarter. This course is required for and limited to students in the Corporate Governance and Practice LL.M. Program. Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance, and assignments. Class will meet according to the schedule set forth by the Registrar's office.",

The colloquium meets in two quarters. During the fall quarter classes meet weekly. In the Spring quarter, the class meets 4 times in weeks 2, 3, 4 and 9 and in addition, will have one Saturday workshop where students will present their capstone research papers.  Over the course of these two quarters students will develop, write, and present a capstone research paper on a contemporary environmental law issue related to their home country and/or region. During the autumn quarter, students will begin to develop their capstone research papers by developing their proposals, outlines and literature reviews. During the spring quarter, the students will write and present their research papers. Across the two quarters we will also explore and discuss a diverse range of environmental law and policy matters through readings and class discussions.  Over the course of the year, the Colloquium invites a number of guest speakers, including academics, practicing attorneys and diplomats. Some of the guest seminars take place during regular class hours and some outside of these class hours.  Grading in this course is based on an analytical research paper, the capstone research paper (including the proposal, outline and literature review), presentation of the capstone research paper, and class participation.  This course is required for students in the Environmental Law &amp; Policy LL.M. Program.",

        "description": "This course enables IELBP advanced degree students to explore selected issues, case studies and policy debates in international economic law and business, global political economy, and international economic dispute resolution in a highly interactive seminar. The course is a complement to the other core degree requirements of the LLM in IELBP and is discussion-oriented. The course offers students the opportunity to engage in dialogue with experts in the field (including expert practitioners, Stanford Law faculty and interdisciplinary scholars from other schools, departments or programs at Stanford University). The course takes on a wide-ranging approach: we will examine legal issues confronting international business while also focusing on cutting-edge debates arising out of economic globalization; we will explore the complex architecture of international economic law, unpacking how international institutions and public international law sources (formal and informal) regulate: i) cross-border business transactions between private parties, ii) international economic relations between and among states, and iii) cross-border economic conduct by states, international organizations, and private actors. Students are expected to have carefully read assigned materials in advance of each session, and to actively participate during class. Grades for the colloquium are based on students' papers, a presentation, and their classroom performance (e.g., preparation, participation, attendance, etc.). The course extends over two quarters (autumn and spring), and students are required to complete both quarters in order to satisfy the program requirement. Topics in the Fall quarter will focus on developments in world trade law, international monetary cooperation, international investment law, economic integration and development, international taxation, international arbitration, and international antitrust law among others. Topics in the Spring quarter will be selected based on students' interests, as well as pressing policy concerns in international commerce.",

The colloquium is held in the Fall and Spring quarters and aims to give the LST LLM students a broad overview of the many areas within Law, Science and Technology, as well as the connections between areas.  In Fall, we will focus on Internet Law and Intellectual Property, including sessions on privacy, free speech, copyright, and patents, with extra focuses on biotechnology and bioscience. In Spring, we will broaden our scope to a selection of issues including potentially AI, dark patterns, more on biotechnology &amp; bioscience, telecommunications regulation, or legal practice. Furthermore, we will discuss how the law of science and technology is made in the United States, and how lawyers can effect change in these laws. The class will feature several guest speakers who are experts in the field, including potentially Stanford faculty, visiting scholars, technology and IP lawyers, entrepreneurs, and executives from Silicon Valley technology companies.  Students are expected to have carefully read the assigned materials in advance of each session, and to actively participate during class. Students will also write a capstone paper on a topic of their choice, in consultation with the instructor. There will also be oral presentations on their capstone papers and on current events in LST. Grades for the colloquium are based on students' papers and their classroom performance (e.g., preparation, participation, attendance, etc.). This course is restricted to students in the Law, Science, and Technology LLM program, and satisfies their &quot;colloquium requirement&quot; for the fall and spring quarter.

Its main goal is to offer students an interdisciplinary perspective about socio-legal research, and research tools for implementing their individual research projects. This Winter term workshop will complement the Research Design for Empirical Legal Studies Seminar taken in the Autumn by 1) expanding and elaborating on some of the methods analyzed during the seminar; and 2) assisting students in using such methods towards their individual research project. The workshop will consist of specialized sessions, most of them tailored towards the work of empirical research that occurs after the data collection phase. During the quarter the fellows are expected to submit drafts of different chapters of their thesis and present their preliminary findings in class. If appropriate, the workshop may also include group and/or individual sessions designed to address the very specific needs of the research undertaken by the SPILS Fellows. Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance, written assignments and final presentations. Enrollment is restricted to SPILS fellows. The seminar is required for JSM graduation. Class will meet online (Zoom) and in-person to be arranged by the instructor with the students.",

        "description": "This course introduces students to the goals, rules and responsibilities of the American legal profession and its members. The course is designed around the premise that the subject of professional responsibility is the single most relevant to students' future careers as members of the bar. These issues come up on a constant basis and it is critical that lawyers be alert to spotting them when they arise and be educated in the methods of resolving them. As such, the course will address many of the most commonly recurring issues that arise, such as confidentiality, conflicts of interest, candor to the courts and others, the role of the attorney as counselor, the structure of the attorney-client relationship, issues around billing, the tension between &quot;cause lawyering&quot; and individual representation, and lawyers' duty to serve the underrepresented. The course will consider the overlapping, inconsistent, and incomplete sources of the regulation of lawyers in the United States. International graduate students will bring their own experiences to compare with standards applicable to legal behavior in different jurisdictions. The course will also instill familiarity with much of the coverage and testing methods of the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination that is required by virtually every U.S. state and territory for licensure. Individual and group participation in class discussion is vital, as well as good faith completion of review questions and/or brief quizzes on the daily reading assignments. Students will work regularly in small groups to discuss hypothetical problems during each class. Each student must also submit a brief reflection paper on five occasions during the course.. The instructor retains the right to take class participation and attendance into account in the final assessment. This course is taught on an accelerated basis with an introductory class at Orientation and classes on most days during the three weeks between Orientation and the beginning of the Autumn Quarter classes.
