        "description": "Imagine collecting a bit of your saliva and sending it in to one of the personalized genomics company: for very little money you will get back information about hundreds of thousands of variable sites in your genome. Records of exposure to a variety of chemicals in the areas you have lived are only a few clicks away on the web; as are thousands of studies and informal reports on the effects of different diets, to which you can compare your own. What does this all mean for you? Never before in history humans have recorded so much information about themselves and the world that surrounds them. Nor has this data been so readily available to the lay person. Expression as &quot;data deluge'' are used to describe such wealth as well as the loss of proper bearings that it often generates.  How to summarize all this information in a useful way? How to boil down millions of numbers to just a meaningful few? How to convey the gist of the story in a picture without misleading oversimplifications? To answer these questions we need to consider the use of the data, appreciate the diversity that they represent, and understand how people instinctively interpret numbers and pictures. During each week, we will consider a different data set  to be summarized with a different goal. We will review analysis of similar problems carried out in the past and explore if and how the same tools can be useful today. We will pay attention to contemporary media (newspapers, blogs, etc.) to identify settings similar to the ones we are examining and critique the displays and summaries there documented. Taking an experimental approach, we will evaluate the effectiveness of different data summaries in conveying the desired information by testing them on subsets of the enrolled students.",

You will get exposure to a variety of current data types from imaging and omics to patient-centric and digital health generated data types. You will also be exposed to the core methodological concepts useful to analyze these data in isolation or in combination. Specifically, in four separate modules taught by expert faculty in each area the basic principles of each module will be defined and explained. Module 1, Clinical Data and Systems, will explain the basics of Electronic Health Records, and how they operate in health care settings. Next, Module 2, Image Data Health Science, will focus on an introduction to the main imaging modalities in medicine and how methodological analysis using machine vision can be used on large studies. Module 3 will focus on fusing different data streams such as clinical, imaging, molecular and other data modalities. Finally, Module 4 will focus on reproducibility, evaluation and ethical issues when deploying models based on biomedical data, with emphasis on translation to practice.  Emphasis will be placed questions, data and methods that advance health and medicine.  Primary learning goals for this course include how to frame biomedical health questions, what data are needed to answer those questions, and what methodological constructs can be leveraged to probe and answer those questions.  This course is a newly designed course for the PhD program of the Department of Biomedical Data Science but open to all.",

        "description": "Almost no country anywhere in the world can afford their healthcare. Starbucks spends more money on healthcare than their coffee. General Motors spends more money on healthcare than steel for their cars. The macro economic effects of healthcare costs along with significant sociodemographic shifts impact every part of our society. In the United States there have been twin massive policy responses (health technology and health payment reform) which are now being coupled with unprecedented venture and industry activity. nnThe purpose of this course will be to understand real world and industry based opportunities within the healthcare system. The course will offer an introductory framework for understanding healthcare configuration encompassing macro economics, health policy 101 and market dynamics. The bulk of the course will focus on the major changes in how (big) data and analytics is being applied in industry and why this matters. There will be an introduction to the most relevant frontier technologies being applied to healthcare data including but not limited to mobility, connectivity, machine learning, &quot;omics&quot;. Each technology will be showcased by a seminar with a relevant company outlining their business model application to a care healthcare data technology. nnWhat differentiates this course from other health policy and health data courses:n-- Marketplace overview + trends (Prospective look at new emerging models versus what has previously worked)n-- Industry perspectiven-- Venture perspectiven-- Data in action (industry applications of &quot;big data&quot;)n-- Course will be heavily focused on real world/industry based application.",

        "description": "Machine learning has driven remarkable advances in many fields and, recently, it has been pivotal in enhancing the diagnosis and treatment of complex brain disorders. Biomedical and neuroscience studies frequently rely on neuroimaging as it provides non-invasive quantitative measurement of the structure and function of the nervous system. Machine and deep learning methods can, for example, refine findings for specific diseases or cohorts enabling the detection of imaging markers at an individual level. This, in turn, paves the way for personalized treatment plans. In this course, we explore the methodological gaps in analyzing high-dimensional, longitudinal, and heterogeneous neuroimaging data and study novel, robust, scalable, and interpretable machine learning models for this purpose.Students have the option to enroll in the class for either 3 or 4 units. All students, regardless of their unit choice, are expected to attend every class session. The primary class content will cover the fundamentals of machine learning, offer some limited hands-on training, and explore the application of ML to neuroimaging. Those opting for 4 units will benefit from an extra hour of instruction weekly, diving deeper into core ML concepts and receiving extended hands-on training. The scheduling of this additional hour will be determined based on the availability of the students enrolled for 4 units to ensure a mutually convenient time slot. Undergraduate students and those who do not have ML backgrounds are advised to take the course for 4 units.",

In parallel, progress in deep neural networks are revolutionizing fields such as image recognition, natural language processing and, more broadly, AI. This course explores the exciting intersection between these two advances. The course will start with an introduction to deep learning and overview the relevant background in genomics and high-throughput biotechnology, focusing on the available data and their relevance. It will then cover the ongoing developments in deep learning (supervised, unsupervised and generative models) with the focus on the applications of these methods to biomedical data, which are beginning to produced dramatic results. In addition to predictive modeling, the course emphasizes how to visualize and extract interpretable, biological insights from such models. Recent papers from the literature will be presented and discussed. Experts in the field will present guest lectures. Students will be introduced to and work with popular deep learning software frameworks. Students will work in groups on a final class project using real world datasets. Prerequisites: College calculus, linear algebra, basic probability and statistics such as CS 109, and basic machine learning such as CS 229. No prior knowledge of genomics is necessary.",

You expected to learn the statistical considerations for novel phase I-II trial designs, master protocols for umbrella, platform and basket trials, adaptive and enrichment designs including subgroup selections, estimand, surrogate and composite endpoints, integration of real-world evidence and patient-focused medical product development, and meta-analysis of clinical trial endpoints. Prerequisites: Working knowledge of statistics and R.",

        "description": "The importance of software to science has grown tremendously over the past 20 years. Proper use of standardized Software Engineering techniques, such as cloud computing, testing, virtualization, testing, and source control, is often necessary for high-quality, and replicable science. Software Engineering for Scientists is designed to help researchers, scientists, and non-domain-experts gain hands-on knowledge of the tools and practices that will make your day-to-day work more efficient and less error-prone, be it in academia or industry. Students will learn to adopt the most important and germane of the techniques used in the real world (from startups to large companies), and we will provide you with a good understanding of the tools, approaches, and tradeoffs inherent in writing any kind of program. The class is taught by an expert with 20 years of experience building software, managing engineering and product teams at companies including Google and Twitter who now works primarily in biotechnology and a Professor in the Biomedical Data Sciences with more than 30 years of experience teaching in bioinformatics at both Stanford and UCSF. Pre-recorded lectures will be provided and will cover topics from both a theoretical and practical perspective. In person lectures will be primarily interactive; we will spend time answering students' questions and talking about how these learnings could be useful to their research. There will be a number of assignments and a final project which can be based on students' existing research.",

(2) To sustainably develop pathways to increase access to higher education and to Stanford graduate programs in data science for individuals from backgrounds currently under-represented in those fields.  During weekly class meetings, graduate student participants will learn strategies to create an inclusive environment, approaches to effective mentoring and coaching, and techniques to develop a personalized curriculum with the course staff and guest speakers. They will also be paired with current undergraduates from non-R1 schools with an interest in data science, recruited in partnership with faculty from those institutions. Participants will meet online weekly for one-on-one mentorship where you will expose your mentee to research in data science. During weekly online meetings, you will work with your mentee on a range of activities, planned with assistance from course staff, including planning their course of studies, navigating internship opportunities and preparing applications; tutoring in some aspects of data science; and guidance in engaging in mini-research projects, depending on their interests.",

        "description": "Advancements of machine learning and AI into all areas of medicine are now a reality and they hold the potential to transform healthcare and open up a world of incredible promise for everyone. But we will never realize the potential for these technologies unless all stakeholders have basic competencies in both healthcare and machine learning concepts and principles - this will allow successful, responsible development and deployment of these systems into the healthcare domain. The focus of this course is on the key concepts and principles rather than programming or engineering implementation. Those with backgrounds in healthcare, health policy, healthcare system leadership, pharmaceutical, and clinicians as well as those with data science backgrounds who are new to healthcare applications will be empowered with the knowledge to responsibly and ethically evaluate, critically review, and even use these technologies in healthcare. We will cover machine learning approaches, medical use cases in depth, unique metrics to healthcare, important challenges and pitfalls, and best practices for designing, building, and evaluating machine learning in healthcare applications.",
