How does tech help doctors stay up-to-date? Twitter, Snapchat, lnstagram, and Face book are used to teach physicians and their patients. Online learning systems have replaced most textbooks and social media platforms are now vehicles to disseminate new knowledge. This seminar will explore the best ways to use technology in medical education, with a focus on the application of social media as a key instructional tool. Students will learn about the different stages of education required to become a physician and explore some of the challenges to continuing medical education. Class assignments will include the creation of health education infographics, reading and drafting posts for medical biogs, and critical analysis of medical podcasts. The course will be particularly interesting to pre-medical students who have a background in blogging or pod casting, though such experiences or skills are not prerequisites for enrollment. Throughout the seminar, there will be an emphasis on the impact of digital scholarship. Students will have the opportunity to submit high-quality classwork for possible online publication on several medical education sites made available by the course instructor.",

        "description": "This course is designed to teach medical students Basic Life Support (BLS) CPR and Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR), which is the psychiatric equivalent to CPR but for psychological emergencies. The BLS portion teaches one and two rescuer CPR, management of an obstructed airway, and CPR for infants and children. Upon completion of the course, students receive an American Heart Association certificate in BLS. The QPR portion of the course will allow students to master techniques on how to recognize and respond to an individual in psychological distress and to help in suicide prevention. Our faculty are certified QPR instructors and students will become QPR certified during this course through the QPR Institute certification process. All medical students must be certified in Basic Cardiac Life Support before the end of the first (autumn) quarter. Students who provide documentation of certification received within six months prior to the date of matriculation will be exempted from the requirement. Other Stanford students may take the CPR portion of the course with the permission of the head TA (see below for contact details) and course directors.  Note that QPR is taught in the evening and CPR is taught over 4 hours on a weekend day.",

Initial certification (EMED 201) occurs in the first year and expires 2 years from the initial course. This course will fulfill the requirements of the current BLS certification needed to complete the mandatory Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) training prior to graduation. Student will refresh their skills in one and two rescuer CPR for infants and adults, management of an obstructed airway, and use of an automated external defibrillator. This course is offered every quarter on medical school RRAP days (the third Friday of every 2nd quarter) and requires a permission code to enroll to allow us to balance students across the four available sessions. Note that to be fully registered for the course you must complete a separate form sent out by the head TA in addition to registering in the quarter you take the course; you will not receive course dates and information without completing this form. If you have any questions, or if you are a non-medical student who wishes to take the course, please email the head TA, Haley Morin, at hdmorin@stanford.edu.",

        "description": "Have you ever watched an episode of a medical drama and wondered how the doctor came up with that diagnosis? Or, why they performed that procedure? Do these contemporary television medical dramas really reflect the practice of real life medicine? In this course, we will explore exciting emergency cases from today's medical dramas, discuss the clinical reasoning for arriving at a particular diagnosis, and the rationale for any life-saving therapies or medical procedures. This innovative approach to analyzing and simplifying the practice of emergency medicine represents the intersection of science and modern cinema and is meant for students from all disciplines.

        "description": "VISITING: Closed to visitors. TYPE OF CLERKSHIP: Required. DESCRIPTION: The Emergency Department (ED) provides a unique learning environment as patients often present with undifferentiated chief complaints and experience dynamic changes in their clinical state. Through this clinical exposure, medical students will develop an understanding of the initial approach, management, and treatment of the undifferentiated acutely ill or injured patient and patients with worsening of their chronic disease. Students will perform complaint-directed history and physical exams, develop an appropriately prioritized differential diagnosis, initiate management, and determine the disposition of patients. Additionally, students will be exposed to the impact of social factors that influence a patient's seeking care in the ED along with the structural shortcomings of our current healthcare systems. Students will work a mix of days, evenings, overnights, weekends and holidays as part of their 4 week rotations. In addition to the shift work (approximately 14-16 shifts) they will participate in didactics, web-based learning, simulation exercises, and case presentations. Students will have shifts in both the Adult and Pediatric ED and be assigned to work with a senior Emergency Medicine resident under the supervision of an Emergency Medicine attending. Students will be required to take the NBME Shelf Examination in Emergency Medicine. PREREQUISITES: None. PERIODS AVAILABLE: 1-12, full time for 4 weeks, 6 students per period from P1-P3, 10 students per period from P4-P12. CLERKSHIP DIRECTOR: Moises Gallegos, M.D., moisesg@stanford.edu.

        "description": "VISITING: Open to visitors. TYPE OF CLERKSHIP: Elective. DESCRIPTION: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has become increasingly utilized in multiple medical specialties, with emergency medicine at the forefront.  This rotation is designed to introduce point-of-care ultrasound to the clinical medical student and provide more in-depth and hands-on familiarity with bedside US for a variety of modalities. These skills will better equip students to use these techniques at the bedside of any patient in the emergency room or on the floors with greater facility and confidence. It will enhance patient diagnosis and management, procedural guidance, and patient satisfaction. It may even save a life! Primary emphasis will be on developing competent technical skills to enhance image acquisition and interpretation. The applications as defined by the American College of Emergency Physicians will be the main focus. A goal for a minimum number of ultrasound scans will be 25 per application including, eFAST, thoracic, renal, RUQ, aorta, limited ECHO and IVC, first trimester pelvic, DVT, orbital, MSK. Other advanced ultrasound applications will potentially be introduced (airway, bladder, nerve blocks). Students will obtain US images in the Stanford Emergency Department and will have imaging formally reviewed by a US fellowship trained emergency medicine faculty member. Images will be obtained during scan shifts during which students will scan appropriate patients and review images with the faculty member onsite and independently. Students will attend Bedside US didactics offered by an US EM faculty member every Thursday morning, followed by quality assessment (QA) review of Ultrasound scans performed in the ED. Students will have access and be expected to participate in online and computer-based learning that will be provided for them as well. This clerkship requires prior approval by Clerkship Director. Contact clerkship director Dr. Nick Ashenburg (ashenburg@stanford.edu) and clerkship coordinator Ezra Tesfay (etesfay@stanford.edu). For visiting international students, please submit your application directly through the International Visiting Student (IVS) Program via https://med.stanford.edu/clerkships/international.html. Please contact visiting-MD-students@stanford.edu if you have any additional questions regarding the IVS Program. PREREQUISITES: Medicine and Surgery rotations, MS 4/5 given preference over MS3.

DESCRIPTION: The Emergency Department frontline providers are tasked with the rapid assessment and stabilization of patients who present uniquely undifferentiated to the ED 24/7/365.  Exposure to Pediatric Emergency Medicine (PEM) in medical school provides an invaluable opportunity for students to learn about the unique challenges and complexities of children with acute, undifferentiated complaints. This 4-week elective at the SHC Pediatric Emergency Department provides students with educational opportunities that include one-on-one teaching with both Pediatric and EM senior residents as well as Pediatric Emergency Medicine trained fellows and attendings.  There is protected time to attend the EMED weekly grand rounds and resident conferences as well as didactic sessions provided by PEM faculty. This elective will expose the student to a wealth of clinical scenarios, supplemented with didactics and ultrasound teaching, that will address the most common chief complaints.  Traditionally PEM physicians manage pathology from every pediatric subspeciality, and the experience of the student will range from management of the patient with acute illness to day to day chief complaints that bring the patient to the ED provider. Clerkship students will see patients on their own, with senior resident, PEM fellow, and attending guidance. PREREQUISITES: None.  PERIODS AVAILABLE: P4-12, full-time for 4 weeks. 1 students per period. CLERKSHIP DIRECTOR: Jason Lowe DO, jtlowe@stanford.edu, 650-723-9215. CLERKSHIP COORDINATOR: Kristen Kayser, kkayser@stanford.edu, 650-497-3058. REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS:  Where: Stanford Hospital; Time: TBA.  CALL CODE: 0. OTHER FACULTY: Staff.  LOCATION: SUMC.",

        "description": "VISITING: Open to visitors. TYPE OF CLERKSHIP: Selective 1. DESCRIPTION: Overall Description: During this 4-week selective, medical students will develop critical skills in the rapid evaluation and management of undifferentiated and acutely ill patients at the new, state of the art Stanford University Medical Center (SUMC) and Kaiser Santa Clara. Students will be introduced to and gain longitudinal training in Precision Emergency Medicine. Students will be paired with a faculty coach in order to maximize educational opportunities and feedback over the four weeks. With a high level of mentorship and guidance, learners will gain confidence assessing and resuscitating the incredible spectrum of patients presenting at each of these clinical sites. Clinical Duties: Students will work 14, 8-hour clinical shifts during the rotation. Rotators will have the opportunity to play an integral role on the care team, learning to take full responsibility in ensuring their patients receive high quality emergency care. Students will lead the initial assessment of each patient, performing complaint-directed history and physical exam, developing a focused differential diagnosis, and then designing and implementing a targeted care plan with input and support from the attending physician. Students will also learn essential communication skills, acting as the primary contact between the care team, patients, patient's families, consultants and hospital staff. Precision Educational Curriculum: Throughout the rotation, students will have access to a number of supporting educational events outside of the emergency department. Students will attend weekly core curriculum conferences with the Stanford Emergency Medicine residents, as well as a monthly journal club. Rotators will also have dedicated, learner-centered educational sessions focused on bedside ultrasound, laceration repair, and other procedures. Rotators will also engage in a series of interactive, faculty-led case discussions. A student-only simulation experience held at Stanford's innovative Center for Immersive and Simulation Based Learning early in the rotation will help faculty and students develop specific learning plans. The rotation culminates in a final written exam. (PLEASE NOTE: We are currently accepting applications from visiting students for the 2023-2024 application cycle. While we are currently able to enroll visiting students, our ability to have visiting clerkship students is subject to change based on University policy regarding Covid-19.) Visiting students ONLY accepted periods 1-6 and 12, pre-approval is required only for visiting students. Please contact clerkship coordinator Kristen Kayser (kkayser@stanford.edu) to inquire about pre approval process and materials needed for submission. PREREQUISITES: Completed all core clerkships in internal medicine, family medicine, surgery, OB/GYN, psychiatry, neurology, and pediatrics. Stanford medical students must complete EMED 301A. Exceptions only at the discretion of the clerkship director on a case by case basis. PERIODS AVAILABLE: 1-6 and 12, full-time for 4 weeks, 10 students per period. CLERKSHIP DIRECTOR: William Dixon, MD, wdixon@stanford.edu. CLERKSHIP COORDINATOR: Kristen Kayser, kkayser@stanford.edu. REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS: Where: 900 Welch Road Suite 350; Time: TBA. Coordinator will email details one week prior to the first day of the rotation block. CALL CODE: 2 (No call, but a mixture of at least 3 overnights and/or weekend shifts during the EMED block.)
