        "description": "This one-unit pass/fail introductory workshop class is designed for students who are new to working with code and electronics, and will give them the technical background necessary to feel comfortable in digital studio classes such as Embodied Interfaces (162), Drawing with Code (163), Making it With Arduino (130), and other Emerging Media courses. By teaching introductory electronics and programming concepts in a step-by-step, hands-on manner with a focus on creative practice, this workshop class provides an accessible introduction to using electronics in students' own artistic endeavors. Students will learn to program LED strips, read sensors with Arduino, start to code in Processing, and become familiar with methods for connecting all three. Through guided tutorials and creative exploration in class, students will learn a basic skillset for creative practice using electronics and software interfaces, with a focus on skills students can use in their work in future classes. No technical experience required.",

        "description": "This seminar is offered in conjunction with the annual &quot;Arts Immersion&quot; trip to New York that takes place over the spring break and is organized by the Stanford Arts Institute (SAI). Enrollment in this course is a requirement for taking part in the spring break trip. The program is designed to provide a group of students with the opportunity to immerse themselves in the cultural life of New York City guided by faculty and SAI staff. Students will experience a broad range and variety of art forms (visual arts, theater, opera, dance, etc.) and will meet with prominent arts administrators and practitioners, some of whom are Stanford alumni. For further details please visit the Stanford Arts Institute website: https://arts.stanford.edu/for-students/academics/arts-immersion/new-york/In the seminar, we will prepare for the diverse experiences the trip affords and develop individual projects related to particular works of art, exhibitions, and performances that we?ll encounter in person during the stay in New York. Class time will be divided between readings, presentations, and one studio based creative project. The urban setting in which the various forms of art are created, presented, and received will form a special point of focus. A principal aim of the seminar will be to develop aesthetic sensibilities through writing critically about the art that interests and engages us and making art.

In this course, students gain confidence and experience connecting to their artistic voices as we explore the myriad possible career paths artists take to build sustainable careers. The course consists of a series of studio projects, each centered around a different artist whose career and art practice we study. The example artists will be primarily artists of color, or artists from communities which are underrepresented in the art world, with practices and careers ranging from the conventional to the more unusual. The goal of these artist selections is to model the possibilities of an art career for students who do not easily see themselves well represented in the mainstream art world, while also broadening all students&iquest; understanding of the many different methods for making work and practicing as an artist today.",

        "description": "Drawing and Creative Writing is a dynamic mix of hands-on drawing studio time and guided writing assignments. This hybrid studio course invites students to experience the perceptual power of drawing and the written word in concert. Drawing and writing are at the roots of most works of art. An intensive practice of these disciplines gives us a marvelous, meditative place from which to learn about the art one can make, uniquely, and about the wisdom of &quot;beginner's mind.&quot; This course is open to everyone. We will get our hands dirty with the ABCs of drawing, look closely into the visual dimensions of language, make up semiotic games, word-shapes, and in general use drawing to experiment with inventive tensions between text and image. What does it mean to draw with the eyes of a writer? Or to write like an artist? We will see that our work can be both an artifact and a portal that leads to transformative chains of associations. Here are key tools for visual thinking and problem solving and growing our imagination. And as we play with poem-pictures and word-works and images of writing as we interrogate their cross-pollinations, purposes, possibilities our aim will also be to repair our ability to pay sustained attention. So we'll work to expand our awareness, see with fresh eyes, challenge stereotypes, allow wild ideas to flow, and come into direct contact with surprising art. We will look at art history as artists.",

The course will revolve around composition and layout, expressive mark-making, and basic drawing techniques. Mainly using pencil and charcoal as our primary medium, this class will explore dynamic compositions found in nature, gestural figure drawing, and portraiture. Students will also have the opportunity to work on quick and in-depth drawings, gaining a more excellent working knowledge of line, shape, perspective, proportion, volume, and composition. On-campus drawing-based visits will include the Anderson Collection and Cactus Garden. An off-campus docent-led tour at the San Jose Museum of Modern Art will provide students the historical awareness of artists who have worked in this manner. The whole class is meant to be an experimental lab while allowing students to gain a rigorous foundation in drawing. Honing individual style is encouraged!",

The collaborative framework of classes will have them discuss and reflect on relevant themes and issues of our time, selected by the visitor, around which they will conceptualize their projects and develop their practice over a period of ten weeks. Classes will be organized atelier-style, meaning they will be conducted live in the gallery space, which will serve as studio space and be open to public viewing, and they will offer students the experience of artistic growth through the process of working with the visitor.",

Each week we will take inspiration from the drawings of filmmakers, animators, sculptors, illustrators, and artists to copy their styles as a way of learning, and exploring their language and thought. The classes will start with simple drawing exercises to warm up, then proceed to look at the drawings of different kinds of artists to copy the linework, thinking, and techniques in class as a way of exploring the different possibilities and materialities of the medium.

The course delves into the world of interactive AR art, equipping students with the skills to create site-specific AR interventions that not only transform public spaces but also unlock historically important, unseen, or politically relevant layers of these spaces. The course covers storytelling techniques, audio recording and editing, and the use of Unity and other spatial tools for AR creation, equipping students with the skills to weave complex narratives into their AR projects. These narratives can bring to light the hidden histories, untold stories, and socio-political nuances of the chosen spaces, adding a depth of meaning and engagement to their work. Students will engage in a series of projects, culminating in a final project where they will create an interactive, immersive AR piece for a specific location on campus",

        "description": "Storytelling Through Light is an intermediate digital photography course designed to teach students the fundamentals of using light to construct narratives, communicate emotions and create evocative images. Through lectures, screenings and hands-on practice, students will gain a better understanding of how light works in photography and how it can be used to affect the mood, atmosphere and overall look of their work. Most weeks involve an Outdoor Shoot to a location on the Stanford campus for demonstration and real-time practice. Students should be expected to have prior understanding of fundamental principles of camera operation, shooting in manual mode, and editing. Students can use either their smartphone or a DSLR.",

        "description": "With a decrease in available real estate and an increase in virtual real estate via the Internet and new technologies, contemporary artists are developing new means of creative production that do not necessarily require the use of a traditional art studio. This interdisciplinary course follows this line of thought and will function as a means to explore systems of art-making through nomadic practices outside of the traditional art studio. The overall goal of this course is to challenge students to think differently about the nature of studio practice, where they will explore themes of public versus private, and physical versus virtual space through the creation of time-based artwork. By way of lectures, readings, and class assignments students will be introduced to sound, video, social practice, and performance art that will be developed and presented though unconventional means with an emphasis on site.

We will paint at different locations on and off-campus, learning a variety of painting techniques in changing weather and light. This class is great for both true beginners and advanced students. Basic painting skills are incorporated throughout the quarter, with advanced options at each stage. Acrylic paint is versatile and fast-drying; we will use it to get a range of effects from washy watercolor, blended oil effects, and building the surface sculpturally, painting on different surfaces. As we move, we will consider the elements of site and the materiality of paint: water, earth, architecture and the nuance of human gesture. History and memory are parsed in both the visible and hidden worlds around us. On-site paintings are not touched after class; rather they exist as an ephemeral moments in time. Three outside projects allow each person to paint at their own pace, and spend more time developing ideas and skills. In this class, process is privileged and &iquest;failure&iquest; is embraced.  Adventure is our priority; weather is our co-creator. Final projects will be based on individual concepts, allowing each person to stretch creatively and develop their own voice.",

We begin by developing or refining students' fundamental techniques through indoor and outdoor observational drawing. Our focus shifts toward representational and conceptual strategies for storytelling that reference students&iquest; archives, popularized content, literature, historical references and more. Through drawing, we discuss and examine a diverse range of contemporary art to address the legacy of visual art.

The fundamental nuts-and-bolts of basic drawing techniques: light logic, depicting depth and drawing the figure, are integrated into each environment. From the Stanford campus: its cafe's, architecture and landscaping, to redwoods and water, to more urban settings, drawings will range from high-speed gestures to longer, more contemplative work. Through pen, graphite, charcoal, ink, watercolor/gouache and mixed media, we explore dichotomous relationships, as well as those in seemingly perfect harmony. We move from the inanimate to animate, figure and architecture, motion and stillness, to the micro and macro, considering how even the smallest patch of earth may be as monumental as Hoover Tower. Both beginning and advanced students are welcome. Summer.",

Students learn to use both traditional and digital tools and techniques for creating artists' books, and integrate those into final works of art. The course familiarizes students with basic bookbinding processes and forms, as well as various modes of printing and production that facilitate limited artist editions. In addition to making books, we view numerous artists' books in the Bowes Art &amp; Architecture Library collection as well as the collection of the instructor, and meet with practicing artists and book makers. Students create a number of small books, each focused on a particular process but using content of their choice. Upper level students propose and create a more fully evolved final project involving at least one bookbinding process independently researched in consultation with the instructor.",

We will explore digital processes using large format printers, as well as digitally augmented traditional printmaking methods such as monoprints, collographs, woodblock and linocut, aided by dye sublimation, vinyl cutting, and 3-d printing. Students will have access to a wide array of both digital and traditional tools, and will develop projects using a combination of methods, resulting in a body of work. Discussions will address the expansive nature of contemporary fine art printmaking.",

This process is much less toxic that the traditional etching with nitric (which produces toxic fumes) or ferric acid (difficult to clean). These techniques will be complemented by other ones that can be mixed with etching such as photocopy transfers, Chine coll&eacute; (attaching a different color paper between plate and main paper), and mono-printing. Etching/Intaglio (making a mark under the surface of the plate) is one of the most tactile and elegant forms of printmaking. The plate leaves a 3-D line mark and embossed marks in the deep etched areas as well as at the edges of the plate. Many major artists have left memorable images by working in this medium (Rembrandt, Goya, Kathe Kollwitz, Eduard Munch, and many others) influencing many contemporary artists.",

        "description": "Outlaw sensibilities, self-made kinships, chosen lineages, utopic futurity, exilic commitment, and rage at institutions that police the borders of the normal these are among the attitudes that make up queer in its contemporary usage. -David J. Getsy. This hands-on studio based course explores queer as a form of art production. Artists and thinkers use queer to signal defiance to the mainstream and an embrace of difference, uniqueness and self-determination. To be intolerable is to demand that the normal, the natural and the common be challenged. To do this is not to demand inclusion, but rather to refuse to accept any operations of exclusion and erasure that make up the normal and posit compulsory sameness. Queer Sculpture is also about the strategic effort to appropriate and subvert conventional art practices and tactics that may involve everything from shifts in the content of a work and its targeted audience to the methods by which it is produced and its formal properties. The political imperatives of a queer or queered position will shape thematic investigations of practices related to utopic futurity, anti-assimilationist practices, failure, abstraction, the archive, camp, drag and alternative families. Classes will require reading, discussing, and making. Students will produce artwork for critiques and participate in discussions of the readings.

This class will addresses the impact of material and technique upon form and content; therefore understanding the physical and expressive possibilities of diverse materials. Conceptual and technical considerations will be addressed. Students will learn traditional building techniques as needed (wood shop, metal shop, mold making, found object) as well as anti-object techniques. Students will make 3-4 projects that will culminate in a final site-specific installation. We will look at contemporary artists working in the field of installation art. Group discussions, critiques, readings, video presentations, field trips and visiting artists will augment the class. Installation Art is based on the merger of Space and Time and on a relationship between the artist and the visitor. Utilizing your interests and abilities in a variety of subjects and media, you will create environments that immerse the viewer in a sensory/ intellectual/ emotional experience. The material and methods you use can range from everyday objects, to highly personalized forms, from appropriated sounds to surveillance video, from large wall drawings to interactive switches for the participant to manipulate. The class will consist of demonstrations of art skills particularly useful in installation (sculptural, video, audio, interactive media, etc), presentations by the professor, research and reports and journal entries, and weekly critique. Installation Art is a pervasive, varied, global practice for art-making that acts as a gathering place for expression in all media addressing all subjects in a wide range of styles by broad grouping of artists.",

Crowd sourced information is uploaded to social media, which in turn guides our physical meeting places. Google street-view maps our physical world, and augmented reality displays overlay it. How as artists or designers to we grapple with and use this digital / physical permeability to create new experiences and meaning for our current time? This introductory studio course explores various tool sets as well as artists working across these genres.  This course is a good baseline exploration for anyone interested in designing or making art with emerging contemporary tools.",

We will look at the history of algorithmic drawing, including analog precedents like Sol LeWitt and other conceptual artists, along with current pioneers like John Simon Jr., Casey Reas, and LIA. Outputs will involve prints as well as screen-based works. Some basic coding experience is helpful, but not required. Assignments are based on conceptual principals that students can engage with at different coding skill levels. This is a good way for non CS students to explore coding practices as well as for CS students to hone their skills. We will work primarily in the free Processing software for our explorations.",

In this class, we will gain a deep understanding of and draw connections between experimental creative practices in selected indigenous/vernacular cultures across Africa and the Americas. We will do this in order to reimagine frameworks for approaching, creating and experiencing experimental media art outside Western canons. Assignments will require students to engage either their own origin stories, histories and/or other archives of their choice or interest. This source material can be personal, collective, public, general, formal, informal, real or imagined. We will look at different ways of approaching archival material (photographs, sound, video, writing, memory) for the purposes of connecting disparate elements into brief and cohesive or anti-cohesive animations. This is an introductory experimental animation class, so no prior experience of animation or video/sound editing is needed.",

What is left out of the current conversation around VR that you would like to explore?nnIn this introductory studio art course, students will learn to create artworks using virtual reality systems. We will use the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Daydream VR headsets, as well as more accessible phone-based augmented reality systems to explore this medium. Through lectures and research presentations, we will familiarize ourselves with the artistic history of VR - from foundational works from the 1990's through current examples -  in order to inform our own work. nnStudents will become familiar with the fundamental studio art practice of analyzing and critiquing their own and others' projects. Learning to analyze artwork in turn helps students create works with more emotional and conceptual impact.  nnWhile there are no official prerequisites for this course, familiarity with any kind of scripting language or coding environment will be helpful as Unity will be used as the main authoring environment.",

We cover fundamental principles of camera operation, composition and image editing. Through digital instruction, students learn to use DSLR or Mirrorless cameras and to operate manual settings (focus, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, color temp/white balance). They learn basic file management as well as the use of Adobe Lightroom software. Students acquire an essential knowledge of contemporary art photography, including standards of quality and image sequencing. They get a basic sense of aesthetics and of the critical discourse that exists around the cultural significance of images. Students will need a DSLR or Mirrorless camera.

A zine is a DIY small-circulation, self-published print work of original or appropriated texts and images, usually produced in small, limited quantities. Discussions, projects, and readings focus on the photography zine for the preservation of minority and marginalized interests. This course familiarizeS students with analog DIY techniques for using original and appropriated photography. Students are asked to consider how their voices can be expressed through introspection, engagement with personal history, cultural subjectivities, and activism. Students are introduced to artists who make zines and why this structure is vital to their practice and community-building efforts. Emphasis is placed on actions of presence, joy, experimentation, and intention rather than perfection. All experience levels are welcome. We visit the SFMOMA and the zine collections from the San Francisco Library and view collections from the Marjorie Barrick Museum of Art in Las Vegas, NV. Additionally, we collaborate with and attend a workshop with the Italic program at Stanford.",

Rather than addressing the ways in which art has assisted the biological sciences (as in medical illustration), we'll focus on the ways in which biology has influenced the art-making practice. Course material will address our changing conceptions of biology and the monstrous, and the ways in which artists engage these cultural shifts.  Students are responsible for creating art works that address these themes and others that emerge from class discussions and presentations, in any medium of their choosing.",

        "description": "This interdisciplinary hands-on course covers the lifecycle of an Artwork in which we work together as a class to imagine, create, and document a temporary public installation at the Anderson Collection alongside a guest artist. We subsequently publish an Artist's zine to share our process and documentation of our completed public artwork.  We place a significant emphasis on recording our process throughout the quarter. Documentation is vital in preserving and researching Art, and a document is typically considered evidence supporting a fact. In art documentation, that &quot;fact&quot; is generally a given artwork or an aspect of an artist's life and how the work is remembered long after it has been removed from public view. In this course, we focus primarily on sculptural installation, photography, writing, and design.",

They will create work using the process of cyanotyping, the low-cost photographic printing technique of a century ago that now functions as an Instagram filter. Using these blue-prints as a touchstone, we will explore blue as a physical, natural, artistic and spiritual manifestation. Students provide their own cell phone camera of choice, and software will be provided.",

Students leave this course with an articulated artistic vision, an understanding of the specific context in which they see their work developing, and a set of research questions on which to base future bodies of work. The critical thinking, writing, research techniques and artistic materials developed in this course will prepare students for the more self-directed work required in the 200 level studio courses and in the Major Capstone course leading to the majors senior exhibition.

Recognizing a planetary paradigm shift fueled by the multivalent advances and crises of our time, Metaspore applies Yi's artistic practice as a philosophy for bringing the arts and sciences together in action before a new paradigm solidifies. For Metaspore: The Networked Sensorium, Yi and instructor Miguel Novelo will guide students through immersive media and extended reality experiments exploring both the human and more-than-human sensorium. This class will question how we can augment our own perceptions and intuitions, while also considering the diverse sensory ecologies of other life forms and incorporating these ideas into our immersive practices. Technologies explored include game engines, 360 video, 3D scanning, photogrammetry, spatial audio, etc.  Field work will include lab and studio visits, as well as a nature retreat within the Bay Area. Limited enrollment; students must submit application (http://bit.ly/3WAf6fT) for consideration by March 1, 2023.

We will get dirty with the ABCs of drawing while playing with freeing constraints and looking closely into the visual dimension of words. Through a spirited, daily practice students will learn how to trust and blast open the art that they &iquest;uniquely&iquest; make. Students will create their own semiotic games, word-shapes and poem-pictures. Investigating cross-pollinations, intersections and possibilities as points of departure, we will experiment with inventive tensions between visual and written images. We will look at (and write about) art history as artists.",

Students lift images by redrawing and transforming them using charcoal, ink, color.

In addition to making books, we view numerous artists' books in the Bowes Art &amp; Architecture Library collection as well as the collection of the instructor, and meet with practicing artists and book makers. Students create a number of small books, each focused on a particular process but using content of their choice. Upper level students propose and create a more fully evolved final project involving at least one bookbinding process independently researched in consultation with the instructor.",

Techniques will be demonstrated in class, and students will pursue projects using these techniques, developing their own conceptual interests. We will explore digital processes using large format printers, as well as digitally augmented traditional printmaking methods such as monoprints, collographs, woodblock and linocut, aided by dye sublimation, vinyl cutting, and 3-d printing. Students will have access to a wide array of both digital and traditional tools, and will develop projects using a combination of methods, resulting in a body of work. Discussions will address the expansive nature of contemporary fine art printmaking.",

        "description": "This hands on studio based sculpture course focuses on developing concepts, and creating a site-specific installation art project. This class will addresses the impact of material and technique upon form and content; therefore understanding the physical and expressive possibilities of diverse materials. Conceptual and technical considerations will be addressed. Students will learn traditional building techniques as needed (wood shop, metal shop, mold making, found object) as well as anti-object techniques. Students will make 3-4 projects that will culminate in a final site-specific installation. We will look at contemporary artists working in the field of installation art. Group discussions, critiques, readings, video presentations, field trips and visiting artists will augment the class. Installation Art is based on the merger of Space and Time and on a relationship between the artist and the visitor. Utilizing your interests and abilities in a variety of subjects and media, you will create environments that immerse the viewer in a sensory/ intellectual/ emotional experience. The material and methods you use can range from everyday objects, to highly personalized forms, from appropriated sounds to surveillance video, from large wall drawings to interactive switches for the participant to manipulate. The class will consist of demonstrations of art skills particularly useful in installation (sculptural, video, audio, interactive media, etc), presentations by the professor, research and reports and journal entries, and weekly critique. Installation Art is a pervasive, varied, global practice for art-making that acts as a gathering place for expression in all media addressing all subjects in a wide range of styles by broad grouping of artists.&quot;",

        "description": "Students engage in professional sculpture (studio) practices that prepare them to apply and extend the skills, methods and techniques they have learned in previous courses, including technical and conceptual skills in woodworking, metal working, mold making, and other sculptural production. These practices involve working collaboratively, taking on short-term projects, handling an increased sculpture work flow, actively participating in regular critiques, and contributing to and showing work in a small final exhibition. Students refine their aesthetic, tap the interdisciplinary network of influences they have built, and work independently to become adept at presenting their ideas and building a portfolio to show the art they have produced to potential clients in a 'real world' professional context. Anyone interested in taking this class should apply with a project in mind that they aim to develop over the length of the course. Since these projects will require a considerable amount of independent work outside class time, students should submit a 1-to-2-page description outlining what they want to focus on and a portfolio featuring some images of work they have already created in that realm. Upon careful evaluation, students with the strongest proposals will be selected. This course may be repeated for credit.",

This interdisciplinary knowledge is to be expanded upon over a lifetime in settings such as the artists studio and applied fields such as AR/VR and user interfaces. Projects will concentrate on visual style (abstract to representational), storytelling, and personal expression. Emphasis will be placed on storyboarding to produce cohesive visual statements.

Where do fiction and autobiography embrace? What does self-portraiture have to do with either? Students will animate their findings using collage, video, drawing, and repetition. We will first gather sounds, memories, found objects, and new experiences to workshop our personal self-portrait. An essay by Toni Morrison, &quot;The Site of Memory&quot;, and a variety of experimental media practices will guide us.

The first quarter of the course is a seminar, which focuses on the history of design practices and theories in a broad range of fields including design, art, and architecture. We will examine how well known concepts such as &quot;The Bauhaus&quot;, &quot;the designer&quot;, &quot;Design Thinking&quot;, and metaphors such as &quot;workshop&quot;, &quot;school&quot;, &quot;laboratory&quot;, &quot;studio&quot;, or &quot;post-studio&quot; arise, and how they shape the artist or designer's work in a particular cultural context. Through reading, writing, and discussion, students will attempt to define their current position within a historical context and chart their future vision. The course may involve guest lectures and visits to various collections and archives.",
