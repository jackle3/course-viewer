The goal is for cadets to have a more in-depth understanding of how to effectively lead people, and provide them with the tools to use throughout their detachment leadership roles.  Secondly, cadets will hone their writing and briefing skills.  Many of the cadets will be uncomfortable with public speaking, and this semester is designed to get them used to briefing.  The second semester is centered on leadership and ethics, and is mostly guided discussion.  The goal here is to get cadets thinking about leadership through their own lens, and give them some tools to work on their leadership skills.",
