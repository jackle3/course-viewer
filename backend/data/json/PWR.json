        "description": "PWR1A classes are small, workshop-style meetings that encourage extensive interaction between students and instructors. The course asks, what does popular culture say about the larger culture and uses questions about popular culture - music, movies, sports - for writing and researching. How do video games teach engineering and physics? How do detective and courtroom dramas lead to discussions about DNA analysis? We look at pop culture as cultural critics, using ideas about technology, society, and economics to analyze human behavior. We will study theories about media to research how everyday artifacts are both trashy and poignant signs of our culture. We will write an analytical essay about cultural commentary, learn about library research to explore topics of your choice, and share our research. We will work together as a group to practice collaboration and project-based learning. Enrollment is intended for varsity student-athletes. PWR1A does not meet the Stanford first-year writing requirement.",

In this course, we examine the ways that environmental and conservation writers from classic environmental writers to contemporary activists talk about nature to see how close readings of their work highlight fundamental disagreements about justice and politics in societies across the globe.

Rhetorical listening has been central to feminist rhetorical praxis, which has traditionally focused on the rescue, recovery, and (re)inscription of non-majority cultures and communities into the rhetorical tradition. In short, rhetorical listening asks us to reconsider the role listening plays, and the values which we ascribe to listening, in processes of knowledge construction inside and outside the academy.

This course asks: How can emotions be motivating, and what can invoke them? How do the systems and structures that we navigate daily create conditions for anxiety or panic, and how do such systems respond to it? How do we understand anger in relation to ideals and social action? How is suffering and pain understood and treated? What is happiness, and should it be the ultimate goal? To what extent can emotions be understood as social or inherently human phenomena? We will approach these questions from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, from cognitive science and social psychology to philosophy, communication and sociology.

Yet, push alerts from news apps and social media also shape our daily conversations. In this class, we will investigate the news industry, examining the challenges faced by journalists today and emerging new forms of digital journalism. We will focus on the political, economic and technological forces that have shaped the writing and rhetoric of journalists. Students might explore debates such as fake news, bias and objectivity; partisanship and polarization; or polling and political coverage. We start by writing an analytical essay about multimedia reporting, move into writing about research regarding a topic of your choice, and close by sharing research in oral presentations. At each step, we work together as a group, doing workshops, engaging in discussion, and collaborating in peer review. Our research projects will provide the opportunity to engage with recent scholarship and stake out your own positions on the future of journalism.",

        "description": "Life challenges us to become aware of the stories that shape us--family stories, cultural mythologies, even popular movies, television shows, and songs--and then create and live our own story.  We face this challenge throughout our lives but perhaps most acutely as we move into adulthood; this is the period when we most need to become conscious of stories and their power, to gather wisdom, practices, and resources for finding our own story.  This class, designed with seniors in mind, will illuminate and explore these resources and give you the opportunity to reflect deeply, in discussion and writing, on what truly calls to you in this life. We will engage with some of the world's great stories--myths, parables, teaching tales, modern fiction, even aphorisms, koans, and riddles.  In them we can find both elements that resonate with our own story and provocations that help us unearth and cultivate our native gifts--the genius in each of us. We will look at short excerpts from masterworks and myths from around the world, all voices in the largest conversation we have as humans, the one that asks: who am I? why am I here? what truly matters? how can I be happy? Together we will investigate how these stories, and stories like them, can be used to help us find our own story.

In this seminar, we first break down the various codes and generic features of currently popular vlogs, then apprentice to current scripting techniques being used by playwrights (Anna Deavere Smith, Suzan-Lori Parks) and scriptwriters on shows from Hulu (East Los High), and Prime (Frankenstein Chronicles), then finally turn our hand to the scripting, rehearsing, shooting, and production of our very own 1-3 minute videos. Our goal is to develop the critical, creative, and digital tools to make effective and engaging scripted short videos for the telling of our current stories, for the destabilization of dominant cultural stories, and for the re-stabilization of the two in potent remix.",

For example, we will analyze key theories about the relation of institutions, doctors, and patients, from Foucault's Birth of the Clinic to Rita Charon's Narrative Medicine: Honoring the Stories of Illness. We will also investigate how patients make sense of their illnesses through art and memoirs, how doctors are trained in an empathetic bedside manner, and the rhetoric of medical breakthroughs. From this foundation, students will choose an issue to tackle in their own research projects, from the politicization of Planned Parenthood and women's healthcare, to the experience of trans patients seeking care, to the rhetoric of access vs. coverage in current debates about health insurance.

        "title": "Brave New Worlds: An Introduction to (De)colonial Rhetorics",
        "description": "Since the time of Columbus, colonial agendas and policies have engendered their own rhetorics of justification and explanation. After all, European modernism began with the encounter of the New World, and Europe&iquest;s own identity was forged in the process of &iquest;Latinization&iquest; of the Western Hemisphere. In response, decoloniality arose as a rich intellectual critique in the late 1990s in South America and the Caribbean. Decolonial rhetorical traditions stand in a unique position vis-&agrave;-vis the development of modernity, colonialism, racialized identities, the crisis of European reason, and the dawn of globalization. In an era of Trumpism, in which European modernity once again justifies restricting the mobility and freedom of Latinx immigrants, among other ethnic groups, perhaps no other form of intellectual critique seems quite so urgent. This course introduces students to primary decolonial rhetorical texts and asks students to apply these insights to pressing contemporary challenges by practicing deep reading of primary and secondary texts, preparing group presentations, and exploring creative acts of composition with an eye toward imagining brave new worlds and the decolonial rhetorical practices valued therein.",

In this course, we'll extend this discussion by expanding our thinking about rhetoric as a means of persuasion to consider its relation to empathy-as a mode of listening to and understanding audiences and communities we identify with as well as those whose beliefs and actions can be lethal. We'll also practice compassion medication and empathetic rhetoric to see how these ethical stances affect us individually and investigate the ways they may and may not be scaled to address social justice more broadly. Finally, with the course readings and discussions in mind, you will explore a social justice issue and create an essay, a workshop, campaign or movement strategy, podcast, vlog, infographic, Facebook group, syllabus, etc. to help move us closer to positive change.

For many citizens who desire a truly representative government, SCOTUS's decision predicted the collapse of democracy and endorsed White supremacy. In this course, through an examination of jurisprudential racism and misogyny, students will learn to dissect the rhetoric of the U.S. judicial branch and the barriers it constructs to equity and inclusion through caselaw and appellate Opinions. The United States of America long deprived the right to vote to men of color and women of every race, and equal access to justice including at the intersections has been an enduring fight. The history of employment law, criminal justice, access to healthcare, and more includes jurisprudence enforcing racist and misogynist U.S. policies and social dynamics. Students will learn how to read a case, scrutinize court briefings, and contextualize bias as a foundation to erect a more just, equitable, and inclusionary legal system.",

Together we will research chronically understudied voices and contributions in the history of science and technology and have the opportunity to read and participate in some of the efforts to highlight their stories through a Wikipedia edit-a-thon and final research project. We will also rigorously think through why the historical and current under-representation of women and people of color matters for the questions that are asked, methodologies that are used, and science and technology that is eventually produced.

        "description": "'Human rights' often sounds like it needs defending in far-off places: in distant public squares where soldiers menace gatherings of citizens, in dark jails where prisoners are tortured for their politics, in unknown streets where gender inequality has brutal consequences. But Bryan Stevenson, a lawyer fighting for social and racial justice in the jails of Alabama, proposes that we try 'proximity': that we get close to the injustices that are already close to us. This class thus takes human rights as a local issue, focusing on how terms like 'human' and 'rights' are interpreted on our campus and in our neighborhoods, cities, and region. Instead of a traditional human rights policy framework, we'll use the lens of intersectional ethics to explore specific rhetorical issues in gender politics, citizenship, higher education, police brutality, and mass incarceration. We will write, speak, and move across genres, responding to the work of incarcerated artists, creating embodied workshops, 'translating' ideas into new media (does someone you know need an animated video about gender pronouns? Or maybe it's time for a podcast about #PrisonRenaissance?), doing collaborative research, and 'writing back' to our audiences.
