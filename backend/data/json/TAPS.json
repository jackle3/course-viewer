        "description": "TAPS 1 provides you with a solid foundation in Theater Studies and traces the development of the burgeoning field of Performance Studies. We will consider a range of canonical plays and emerging performance forms, and explore how performance can also function as an interpretive framework for analyzing a broad range of social behaviors, sites, and institutions. Through a series of close readings, discussions, written and practical exercises, and viewings of live performance, this course will help you achieve a richer understanding of the performances you see and the performances you may wish to make. This quarter, TAPS 1 will serve as the platform for the Theater &amp; Performance Studies professionalization series. We will host several guest speakers (directors, actors, playwrights, and dance practitioners), who will give you some real connections in the theater world and will provide you with information and skills to help you build a career in the arts.",

Conventional wisdom says that theater is a dying art, and a lost cause, especially in an age of multi-media entertainment. But there are more young playwrights, actors, and directors entering the field today than at any other time in American history. Focus is on the work of today's theater artists, with an emphasis on an emerging generation of playwrights. Students read a cross-section of plays from writers currently working in the US and UK, covering a spectrum of subjects and styles from serious to comic, from the musical to the straight play. Hits and misses from recent seasons of the New York and London stages and some of the differences of artistic taste across the Atlantic. Hands-on exploration of the arts and skills necessary to make a play succeed. Students develop their own areas of interest, in guided projects in design, direction or performance. Conversations with playwrights, designers ,and directors. Labs and master classes to solve problems posed in areas of creative production. Class meets literary managers and producers who are on the frontlines of underwriting new talent. Class trips include two plays at major Bay Area Stages.",

        "description": "This seminar is offered in conjunction with the annual &quot;Arts Immersion&quot; trip to New York that takes place over the spring break and is organized by the Stanford Arts Institute (SAI). Enrollment in this course is a requirement for taking part in the spring break trip. The program is designed to provide a group of students with the opportunity to immerse themselves in the cultural life of New York City guided by faculty and SAI staff. Students will experience a broad range and variety of art forms (visual arts, theater, opera, dance, etc.) and will meet with prominent arts administrators and practitioners, some of whom are Stanford alumni. For further details please visit the Stanford Arts Institute website: https://arts.stanford.edu/for-students/academics/arts-immersion/new-york/In the seminar, we will prepare for the diverse experiences the trip affords and develop individual projects related to particular works of art, exhibitions, and performances that we?ll encounter in person during the stay in New York. Class time will be divided between readings, presentations, and one studio based creative project. The urban setting in which the various forms of art are created, presented, and received will form a special point of focus. A principal aim of the seminar will be to develop aesthetic sensibilities through writing critically about the art that interests and engages us and making art.

        "description": "Who doesn't love going to a play: sitting in the darkened theater, a member of the audience community waiting to be entertained, charmed, and challenged? But how many of us know enough about the details of the plays, their interpretation, their production, and acting itself, to allow us to appreciate fully the theatrical experience? In this seminar, we will spend 14 days in Ashland, Oregon, at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival (OSF), where we will attend these plays: Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and Twelfth Night; Dominique Morisseau's Three Musketeers; Qui Nguyen's Rent; and Where We Belong: A Musical, books and lyrics by Lynn Ahrens and music by Stephen Flaherty.  (To read more about these productions, go to www.osfashland.org). We will also spend time backstage, meeting with actors, designers, and artistic and administrative directors of OSF. Students read the plays before the seminar begins, attend these productions together, and have the time to study one play closely through a second viewing.  In Ashland, students will produce a staged reading and design a final paper based on one or more of the productions. These reviews will be delivered to the group and turned in on Thursday, September 21.",

Class includes conversations with formerly incarcerated youth, prison staff, juvenile justice lawyers and artists working in juvenile and adult prisons as well as those who are part of the 7.3 million people currently on parole or probation. Using performance as our lens we will investigate the unique kinds of understanding the arts make possible as well as the growing use of theater and dance to affect social change and personal transformation among prison inmates.

In this class, you will learn about these topics from the inside out. We will explore various perspectives on sexuality, intimacy, and relationships and then dive into our own stories to discover the richness and vibrancy of our lived experience. Due to the personal nature of the topic, we will emphasize safety, trust, and confidentiality throughout. The class offers the structure and guidance to 1) mine your life for stories, 2) craft the structure and shape of your stories, and 3) perform with presence, authenticity, and connection.

Students will learn how the touring Commedia Dell'Arte troupes of Renaissance Italy subverted the Catholic Church's dominion over public performance and served as a channel for expressing the voice of the people and challenging the dominant power structure. By studying the plays of Dario Fo, the San Francisco Mime Troupe, Mbongeni Ngema, and Percy Mtwa, students will see how this subversive tradition has continued to inform theatrical resistance to oppressive systems all over the world. The historical context will be supplemented with training in physical theatre techniques and writing for the stage. Students will apply these lessons to the ongoing development of an original play, based on their burning issues, which will be performed for the public at the culmination of the course.",

The main question that we will contend with is: how can one achieve an ideal encounter with a people? Through experience and experimentation, we will attempt to approach the region from different angles, perspectives, and disciplines. You can expect to be surprised again and again as we find ways to see, hear, touch, smell, and taste the Middle East through carefully curated readings, viewings, practices, assignments, and events, each teaching us a different way of thinking, creating, and living. Yet, in all these encounters, the theme of performance will return to remind us that knowledge of ourselves and the other is but a tangible exhibit of performances of everyday life. From virtually visiting architectural wonders such as Petra and the Pyramids, to encountering classic literatures such as the Arabian Nights, to finding the best Shawarma in town, to performing the Middle East, to confronting political realities and investigating historical myths, you can expect to immerse yourself with a region and its people. In our search for an ideal encounter, we will be sure to shed some fantasies, experience some realities, imagine some possibilities, and find a version of ourselves.",

This course will explore the history of magic through its theatrical history, exploring important relationships between culture, technological innovation, and illusion-making. From traps, to lifts, to sugar glass props, the stage has absorbed and utilized technological and scientific innovations to create its illusions, narratives, and stories. Techniques of magic and stagecraft have been used since the sixteenth century to imagine other worlds.  In creating these illusions, the theater also negotiated with emerging scientific theories and concepts. We will ask: What relationship does magic and theater have to the stories we tell? What contribution did technological innovations have on illusion making? How did theater makers develop and innovate using technological and scientific theories? What role does technological aesthetics play in understanding human culture?  Together we will explore early writing about performance magic, alchemy, sleight of hand, and theatrical stagecraft. We will read across diverse practices of magic and theatre across the globe, exploring the relationship of magic, culture, and performance. We will read treatises, novels, and plays that explore the nature  and legacy of magic. The course will include discussion, performance exercises, and hands-on activities. At the end of the seminar, students will be able to recognize and discuss historical texts and relate cultural artifacts (plays and novels) to major themes (magic and illusion). The course includes work and writing from authors with diverse backgrounds, ethnicities, and orientations. All are welcome!",

Each week centers one key dance performance alongside one formative text in comparative race studies to allow for close-analysis and critical interpretation, featuring choreographers such as Alvin Ailey, Trisha Brown, Lenora Lee, and Ralph Lemon alongside theorists like Frantz Fanon, Cedric Robinson, Edward Said, Patricia Collins, and Jose Mu&ntilde;oz. Through interdisciplinary modes of knowing, we will pair text and movement through the dancing body to (re)consider the social, historical, and political formations of race and its presentation on and off stage.",

        "description": "Introduction to Theatrical Design is aimed at students interested in exploring the fundamentals of design for the stage.  Students are introduced to the practical and theoretical basics of design and are challenged to answer the question: What makes good design?  Students should expect to try their hand at communicating their ideas visually through research, drawing, sketching and model making.  Readings, field trips, guest lecturers and class discussion will complement these projects. This course is intended as a gateway to more specialized courses in set, costume and lighting design and is also an excellent primer for actors, directors and scholars who wish to know more about design. Collaboration will be emphasized. No prior experience in these areas is necessary.",

This course is intended for singers, pianists, conductors, musical directors and directors of groups that include singers, regardless of style or size of ensemble, with the goal of promoting excellent and healthy vocal performance.

        "description": "In this course we will employ theater foundations (writing, acting, staging and direction) to interrogate individual and collective belief systems prescribed through our lineage, geography, genetics, culture and class. We will ask big questions like: How do we rethink collective narratives? What can be made in the midst of ongoing pandemics and emergencies? Who am I within and beyond my current circumstances? Together we will learn from diverse practitioners within science fiction, documentary filmmaking, theater, site-specificity, and environmental activism to create performances that ignite our imaginations and skillsets for enacting social change.",

However, as contemplatives and scholars from various fields have argued, though the brain resides in the cranium, the mind functions throughout the body. Students in this class will playfully explore embodied and dynamic forms of meditation and mindfulness through movement in an effort to integrate the mind and body. Examples of modalities include Lisa Nelson's Tuning Scores, Barbara Dilley's Contemplative Dance Practices, and other movement practices including qigong, laughter yoga, and psychogeography. Students will work in teams to develop their own movement-meditation scores inspired by these practices.",

You can choose to focus a little on everything, investigate one new area, or try out a few different things. If interested, please email the instructor at yjl@stanford.edu on or after September 15 (any request sent sooner will not be considered) with the following: 1) Your year of study; 2) Your major/prospective major or field of study; 2) Your previous theater practice experience; 3) Potential area/s of interest for this class.

Specific topics may vary by term/year/instructor. This term's topic, Queer Cinemas around the World, engages with a range of queer cinematic forms and queer spectatorial practices in different parts of the world, as well as BIPOC media from North America. Through film and video from Kenya, Malaysia, India, The Dominican Republic, China, Brazil, Palestine, Japan, Morocco, the US etc., we will examine varied narratives about trans experience, same-sex desire, LGBTQI2S+ rights, censorship, precarity, and hopefulness. This course will attune us to regional cultural specificities in queer expression and representation, prompting us to move away from hegemonic and homogenizing understandings of queer life and media. Notes: Screenings will be held on Wednesdays at 5:30PM in Oshman Hall. Screening times will vary slightly from week to week.",

This course will introduce you to a range of media from the Indian subcontinent across commercial and experimental films, documentaries, streaming media, and online cultures. We will engage in particular with questions of sexuality, gender, caste, religion, and ethnicity in this postcolonial context and across its diasporas, including in the Caribbean. Given this course's emphasis on close cinematic analysis, we will analyze formal aspects of cinematography, editing, mise-en-sc&egrave;ne, and performance, and how these generate spectatorial pleasure, star and fan cultures, and particular modes of representation. This course fulfills the WIM requirement for Film and Media Studies majors. Note: Screenings will be held on Thursdays at 5:30 PM. Screening times will vary from week to week and may range from 90 to 180 minutes.",

        "description": "Charting a course from colonial America to contemporary London, this course explores the long history of Black performance throughout an Atlantic diaspora. Defining performance as &quot;forms of cultural staging,&quot; from Thomas DeFrantz and Anita Gonzalez's Black Performance Theory, this course takes up scripted plays, live theatre, devised works, performance art, and cinematic performance in its survey of the field. We will engage with theorists, performer, artists, and revolutionaries such as Ignatius Sancho, Maria Stewart, William Wells Brown, Zora Neale Hurston, Derek Walcott, Danai Gurira, and Yvonne Orji. We will address questions around Black identity, history, time, and futurity, as well as other essential strategies Black performers have engaged in their performance making. The course includes essential methodological readings for Black Studies as well as formational writings in Black performance theory and theatre studies. Students will establish a foothold in both AAAS (theory &amp; methodology) and in performance history (plays and performances). As a WIM course, students will gain expertise in devising, drafting, and revising written essays. This course, as a required course for the Interdisciplinary Arts Minor, will provide foundational readings and perspectives.  All students interested in Honors in the Arts and/or IDA should consider enrolling!",

Supported by findings in modern neuroscience and psychological research, yoga is an ancient, holistic modality that integrates body, mind, and community through ethical awareness, movement, breathing, and meditation. This integration lends itself to embodied, creative expression as wellas other healing modalities you will explore, such as theater and performance, dance, qigong, and laughter yoga. Yoga philosophy and postures are drawn from Dr. Christiane Brem's protocol developed as a therapeutic yoga class. The weekly performance exercises we will practice were developed by theater makers such as Augusto Boal and the UK-based performance duo Curious.",

        "description": "TAPS 119M Special Topics courses feature the annual Mohr Visiting Artist. The Mohr Visiting Artist program brings acclaimed and emerging artists to campus for a one-term period to teach a credited course and provide a presentation, exhibition or performance for the Stanford community and the public. The 21-22 Mohr Visiting Artist is Mikeah Jennings.nn&quot;Real Time Film&quot; is a conceptual model conflating performance, television, and movies. It's a live movie that examines the use of the image in entertainment, how we experience the image versus its manufacture, the split between surface and interior, and the different layers of truth. (Caden Manson, Big Art Group)nnThis Special Topics course is a collaborative workshop, introducing the digital performance style known as Real Time Film. Students will learn fundamental techniques to build upon their performance knowledge while engaging with live-feed cameras, and projections, on stage in real time. This workshop will focus particular attention on the actor in performance, ensemble building, company engagement, and an investigation of the dramaturgy and production techniques of contemporary performance companies utilizing live camera feeds and video projection onstage. Students will explore the works of contemporary companies like The Builders Association, The Wooster Group, Big Art Group, Jay Scheib, as well as international companies like The Gob Squad (UK), Katie Mitchell (UK) and others. The workshop interweaves principles of stage acting, on camera performance, and generative work to help the actor develop the skills that are being used more and more in virtual and mediated performances. Workshop sessions will be supplemented by readings, screenings and professional examples.",

We will explore how a performing artist researches and how that research can be used to enrich and deepen performance. We will practice how to act truthfully and vividly in a variety of theatrical styles.  nnStudents will practice techniques developed by Michael Chekhov, Jerzee Grotowski, and Rudolf Laban, among others. Through monologue and scene work, we will explore performance styles including commedia dell'arte, the comedy of Moli&egrave;re, and postmodern theatre.

In this course, students will practice bringing to life the language of Shakespeare and classical Greek playwrights. Students will explore passionate thought, including metaphor, argument, rhythm, imagery, and sound to realize these powerful texts fully and joyfully. The course will involve discovering the structures in the speeches and scenes which provide clues to the actor as to how to perform them. Using the voice safely with full breath support (so as to avoid injury) while releasing extended sounds like laughing, wailing, crying, and screaming will be explored. Various translations of the Greek texts will be used including those of Luis Alfaro, Declan Donnellan, Anne Carson, Timberlake Wertenbaker, Rush Rehm, Ellen McLaughlin, and others. This class is designed to be the natural next class after taking Voice for the Actor (Voice 1). Students will leave the class with at least one classical monologue suitable to use for auditions.

        "title": "Voice II:  Dialects and the International Phonetic Alphabet (I.P.A.)",
        "description": "One of the most exciting ways an actor can portray a character is by making vocal choices and through use of language - speaking a character's dialect can be crucial to that.  Like a costume, dialect helps tell the story of the character and create an authentic fictional world for the audience.  In this course, we will explore how to learn, rehearse, and perform dialects using a method that is effective, respectful, and fun.  Learning a dialect involves investigating cultural context, vowel and consonant shifts, inflection, rhythm, vocabulary, word pronunciation, and oral posture (where in the mouth the sounds are made and how the mouth shapes sound).  In this class, there will be a focus on listening with awareness, sound analysis, and experientially playing with specific dialects.  Dialect biases, conscious and unconscious, will be examined.  Context, specificity, and intent will be explored so that stereotyping through dialect can be understood and avoided.  Together the class will learn and practice two dialects, using some of the symbols of the International Phonetic Alphabet and Wells' Lexical Set.  Resources for finding dialects (books, links, apps, coaches, personal interviews) will be identified.  The class will culminate with students researching a specific dialect, learning it well enough both to speak it with a text and teach it to others.  In the process, we will identify features of our own individual dialects, known as idiolects.  Enrollment preference will be given to TAPS majors and minors.  There are no prerequisites to take this class, although it will be useful to have taken Voice for the Actor in advance.",

This nonlinear piece involves object manipulation, powerful physicality, and poetic imagery. Instructor Matt Chapman has been developing the piece for several years and will direct the ensemble in the process of bringing it to the stage. Students will contribute original compositions as well. This project needs actors, movers, theatre makers, musicians, a creative lighting designer - and more. Interested in prop-building? Marketing? This project will be produced in a low-tech, low-budget environment. As such, it is a fierce exploration of how to make extremely theatrical moments take shape with limited resources. This course is extremely practical experience for the realities of the professional field. Coursework includes class time plus weekly rehearsal as an ensemble or in small groups outside of class; additionally, there will be several required evening rehearsals during the final week of classes, prior to the show. The performances will occur June 2nd and 3rd, 2023; students should expect 4 hours' time commitment on those two evenings. TAPS 127 (Movement for Actors) is recommended experience for actors but not necessarily required.Please note that the class meets Fridays 12:30-4:20; students should enroll in both Class # 32928 and the Lab, Class # 32985.Instructor approval is required for enrollment.

Awareness, availability, fun, and spontaneity are natural components of playing - but they often fade when actors step onto the stage (or when non-actors step into an important task). Students will develop their capacity to respond freely and to innovate with joyful freedom. In this course, we seek to dissolve the barriers between playfulness and our actions, in order to become more free, authentic, comfortable, and happy - onstage and off. In addition, students will learn creative methodologies for using 'play' to develop new material for the theatre. Developed specifically for Stanford students, this course takes perspectives from clown and physical theatre practice. Using games, improvisation, inquiry, and self-reflection, we will attend the capacity for 'play' like a muscle that can be strengthened. No previous experience is necessary; out-of-class investigation will be required weekly.",

What lessons can we learn from the region's diverse and dynamic island cultures, its entangled histories, and its urgent contemporary issues? How has the Pacific impacted ideas about modernity elsewhere in the world? And what unique Oceanian modernities are emerging from the region? Engaging with a rich array of literary and performance texts, films, and artworks from the 19th to the 21st centuries, we will consider different ways in which the Pacific has been imagined. We will further explore how Pacific Islander scholars, artists, and activists have drawn on their cultural traditions and knowledge systems to create new works that respond to current challenges facing the region, including colonialism, globalization, tourism, migration, climate change, militarization, and nuclearization.

Students will cultivate their skills as artist-scholars through written assignments and the creation of performances in response to the assigned material. Attendance and written reflection about a live performance event on campus are required. Students will also learn various meditation practices as tools for making and critiquing performance, in both our seminar discussions and performance workshops. We will approach mindfulness as method and theory in our own practice, as well as in relation to the works studied. We will also consider the ethics and current debates concerning the mindfulness industry. Examples of artists studied include James Luna, Nao Bustamante, Renee Cox, William Pope.L, Cassils, boychild, Curious, Adrian Piper, Xandra Ibarra, Val&eacute;rie Reding, Guillermo Gomez-Pe&ntilde;a, and Ana Mendieta.",

This seminar asks: why performance? We will adopt methods of performance research and direct them at MMORPGs, hacktivists, YouTube lip-synchers, Instagram feeds, Fortnite dances, and even a few plays. Students will discuss the various utopian affordances and dystopian structures of digital life, and study how conversations about computing have changed over history. They will learn how performances highlight the degree to which contemporary digital culture is constituted by, and further entrenches, race and gender. Ultimately, they will develop their own artworks (games, websites, dances, videos, podcasts) that will embody and question the fraught intersection between computers and performance.",

With its integration of scholarly research and creative practice, dramaturgy is in a position to augment all other areas of performance. For example, more often than not a good director or a good choreographer is also a good dramaturg: an ability to analyze, adapt, and transform an existing dramatic text or weave devised actions into a narrative is essential for the success of a performance; likewise, acting becomes greatly enriched by performers' ability to grasp internal workings of a dramatic text; finally, any kind of design (stage, costume, light, or digital) benefits from skillful plotting of the story through images and sounds. In this class, students will get acquainted with theoretical and historical sources of dramaturgy and explore procedures and techniques they can use in their work on productions.",

How do we confront and redress the impact of racism and bias within the history, theory, and practice of these disciplines? This course invites students to grapple with the complex intersections between race, inequality, justice, and the STEM fields. We orient to these questions from an artistically-informed position, asking how we can rally the embodied practices of artists to address how we think, make, and respond to each other. Combining readings from the history of science, technology, and medicine, ethics and pedagogy, as well as the fine and performing arts, we will embark together on understanding how our STEM practices have emerged, how we participate today, and what we can imagine for them in the future. The course will involve workshops, field trips (as possible), and invited guests. All students, from any discipline, field, interest, and background, are welcome! This course does build upon the STS 51 series from 2020-21, though it is not a prerequisite for this course.  Please contact the professor if you have any questions!",

        "description": "There is a lot of great theater out there waiting to be made, and the primary goal of this class is to help students prepare to achieve that goal. In this class, &quot;history&quot; is not only a narrative about the past and its interpretations, but a repository of ideas and techniques that can provide students with useful techniques and sources of inspiration for their own practice. In the graduate component of the class, we will take a historiographic approach to this art form that has often veered towards the biographical and the anecdotal. This is not a history of directors, but a history of directing. That does not mean that we won't look at the work of individual artists: we will do that, while keeping in mind the historical, social, economic as well as aesthetic circumstances under which directing evolved as a distinct profession in the theater.",

Defining performance as &quot;forms of cultural staging,&quot; from Thomas DeFrantz and Anita Gonzalez's Black Performance Theory, this course takes up scripted plays, live theatre, devised works, performance art, and cinematic performance in its survey of the field. We will engage with theorists, performer, artists, and revolutionaries such as Ignatius Sancho, Maria Stewart, William Wells Brown, Zora Neale Hurston, Derek Walcott, Danai Gurira, and Yvonne Orji.  We will address questions around Black identity, history, time, and futurity, as well as other essential strategies Black performers have engaged in their performance making. The course includes essential methodological readings for Black Studies as well as formational writings in Black performance theory and theatre studies.  Students will establish a foothold in both AAAS (theory &amp; methodology) and in performance history (plays and performances). As a WIM course, students will gain expertise in devising, drafting, and revising written essays.",

        "description": "In 2013, CaShawn Thompson devised a Twitter hashtag, #blackgirlmagic, to celebrate the beauty and intelligence of black women. Twitter users quickly adopted the slogan, using the hashtag to celebrate everyday moments of beauty, accomplishment, and magic.  The slogan offered a contemporary iteration of an historical alignment: namely, the concept of &quot;magic&quot; with both Black people as well as &quot;blackness.&quot;  This course explores the legacy of Black magic--and black magic--through performance texts including plays, poetry, films, and novels.  We will investigate the creation of magical worlds, the discursive alignment of magic with blackness, and the contemporary manifestation of a historical phenomenon. We will cover, through lecture and discussion, the history of black magic representation as well as the relationship between magic and religion. Our goal will be to understand the impact and history of discursive alignments:  what relationship does &quot;black magic&quot; have to and for &quot;black bodies&quot;?  How do we understand a history of performance practice as being caught up in complicated legacies of suspicion, celebration, self-definition? The course will give participants a grounding in black performance texts, plays, and theoretical writings. *This course will also satisfy the TAPS department WIM requirement.*",

The list could go on: homeless, prostitutes, mentally ill, laborers, disabled. Historically, the center stage of Western theater has been reserved for a certain kind of identity: mostly male, mostly upper class, heterosexual, and white European. At the same time, the wings have been teeming with a great diversity of characters. This class focuses on Western cultures' production of its own marginal identities and the role theater in regulating and reintegrating them into society. In this class, we will focus on primary sources, which is to say, on plays. A few of them are canonical, but many of them are not. This investigation of theater's margins will take us to commercial theater, experimental stages, and to the very limits of what is considered 'Western' drama.",

Humanists, artists, and social scientists have explored the political, military, sociological, and religious roots of the modern Middle East from many worthy perspectives that can be found in landmark texts by prolific scholars. However, most of these scholars and the majority of university level courses on the subject of the Palestinians have not paid significant attention to their contributions in the arena of cultural production, particularly in theatre and film. This seminar explores cultural artifacts produced by, for, and on behalf of Palestinians. Throughout the quarter, students will be exposed to foundational texts in the area as well as a number of key films and theatrical plays. The selected works sometimes correspond to historical events, but not always. On occasion, the works function as witness accounts by presenting multiple viewpoints and rich artistically created contexts. The class offers students the opportunity to engage with Palestinians while simultaneously considering foundational relevant concepts in the areas of nationalism, race studies, and postcolonialism. We will aspire to ask useful questions that may help us better understand how and why Palestinians produce performance cultures.",

Yet recently some of the most radical challenges in dance are coming from ballerinas, featuring prosthetic limbs, non-female identifying dancers en pointe, and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish women performing classical repertoire. This seminar uses dance history to reposition ballet as a daring future-facing art form, one where the politics of nationality, religion, class, gender, race, and disability intersect. These issues are provocatively illuminated by classically trained dancers like South African artist Dada Masilo in her gender-bending Swan Lake and Giselle adaptations, Phil Chan's anti-Orientalist restagings, and activist American dancer Alice Sheppard's showcasing of the art of disability partnered by her wheelchair. What can ballet bring to the pressing social issues of equity, inclusion, and diversity when for centuries it has been considered an exemplar of the static imperialist, Western art form and idealized white body? What has shifted to reveal ballet as a vital medium for registering new global identities and social justice challenges? How can an art form built on obedient bodies be politically dangerous?  Exposing limitations of binaries such as masculine/feminine, White/Black, heterosexual/homosexual, and colonial/ colonized histories, we consider how culture is complicated through the ballet repertoire and its techniques for disciplining and gendering bodies. Using live and recorded performances, interviews with practitioners reshaping the field, and close readings of new scholarship, we will see how 21st century politics are being negotiated through ballet in an intersectional frame.",

        "description": "How does race function in performance and dare we say live and in living color? How does one deconstruct discrimination at its roots?n nFrom a perspective of global solidarity and recognition of shared plight among BIPOC communities, we will read and perform plays that represent material and psychological conditions under a common supremacist regime. Where and when possible, we will host a member of the creative team of some plays in our class for a live discussion. Assigned materials include works by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Amiri Baraka, Young Jean Lee, Ayad Akhtar, Susan Lori Parks, David Henry Hwang, Betty Shamieh, Jeremy O. Harris, and Christopher Demos Brown.n nThis class offers undergraduate students a discussion that does not center whiteness, but takes power, history, culture, philosophy, and hierarchy as core points of debate. In the first two weeks, we will establish the common terms of the discussion about stereotypes, representation, and historical claims, but then we will quickly move toward an advanced conversation about effective discourse and activism through art, performance, and cultural production. In this class, we assume that colonialism, slavery, white supremacy, and oppressive contemporary state apparatuses are real, undeniable, and manifest. Since our starting point is clear, our central question is not about recognizing or delineating the issues, but rather, it is a debate about how to identify the target of our criticism in order to counter oppression effectively and dismantle long-standing structures.n nNot all BIPOC communities are represented in this syllabus, as such claim of inclusion in a single quarter would be tokenistic and disingenuous. Instead, we will aspire to understand and negotiate some of the complexities related to race in several communities locally in the U.S. and beyond.",

Do you have something to say about race, class, gender, ethnicity, nationalism, sexuality, yourself, or any other issues? Did you ever want to create and perform your own show but didn't know how to start? This is your chance. In this course, you will learn techniques for creating your own solo show. nnThe contemporary solo performer is descended from a long line that includes the griots of Africa, the troubadours of medieval Europe, and the solo performance artists of the twentieth century. In this course, we will view examples of historical and contemporary live solo performance and uncover principles and practices that will help us develop our own solo shows.nnThrough exercises in acting, writing, and embodied contemplation, students will learn to discover the stories within and around them, and to give voice(s) to their burning issues in a theatrical form that is intimate, idiosyncratic, and deeply personal. The course will culminate in a workshop performance of solo pieces developed by the students.",

Each play will receive a virtual staged reading, followed by comments from the class, and a re-worked reading.

        "description": "With its' lush and fantastic landscape, fabulous carnivalesque aesthetics, and rich African Diaspora Religious traditions, the Caribbean has long been a setting which New World black artists have staged competing visions of racial and sexual utopia and dystopia. However, these foreigner-authored fantasies have often overshadowed the lived experience and life storytelling of Caribbean subjects. This course explores the intersecting performance cultures, politics, and sensual/sexual practices that have constituted queer life in the Caribbean region and its diaspora. Placing Caribbean queer of color critique alongside key moments in twentieth and twenty-first century performance history at home and abroad, we will ask how have histories of the plantation, discourses of race and nation, migration, and revolution led to the formation of regionally specific queer identifications. What about the idea of the 'tropics' has made it such as fertile ground for queer performance making, and how have artists from the region identified or dis-identified with these aesthetic formations? This class will begin with an exploration of theories of queer diaspora and queer of color critique's roots in black feminisms. We will cover themes of exile, religious rites, and organizing as sights of queer political formation and creative community in the Caribbean.",

        "description": "What does it mean to dance black? How can studying comparative dance practices across the United States and the Caribbean expose continuities and differences in African diaspora experience? How can we draw strategies from black performance to inform our current movements for social change? This class will explore how dance and writing about performance have shaped notions of what it means to identify or be marked as an African diaspora subject. From the ring shouts of captive Africans to the 20th-century concert dance stage, from New York queer ballroom culture to Tiktok fads, this class will expose students to both historical and ethnographic methods for using dance to study the formation of black community in the New World. Looking beyond the surface of skin, we'll explore how race is experienced in muscle and flesh, and how black performers have historically taken advantage of or disavowed racialized ideas of how they can/should move. We will read theories of diaspora, queer of color critique and black feminist theory, and performance theory. We will search for the common questions and conversations about embodiment, the spectator's gaze, and black belonging that run through all three disciplines. Students will be required to do some movement research (through accessible, at-home dance practice), write weekly journals, and complete short essay projects. Students develop will skills for writing, speaking, and making performance to explore the intersections between race, sexuality, and dance.",

In the process students gain an understanding of incarceration and its cultural dimensions. Class readings and discussions foreground the legal and social contexts surrounding prisons in the U.S.,  Particular attention will be paid to the nexus of art, community, and social action, and how dance might be used to study the performing arts effects on self-construction, perception, experiences of embodiment, and social control for incarcerated teenagers. The class includes guest speakers who bring important perspectives on criminal justice including returned citizens, a juvenile justice attorney, a restorative conferencing facilitator and a dancer who teaches women in prison to be their own dance instructors.",

This course examines how various scholars, theorists, and practitioners have defined and engaged with material culture. We will read popular theories of thing-ness including but not limited to object-oriented ontology (Bill Brown and Jane Bennett), commodity things (Arjun Appadurai), actor-network theory (Bruno Latour), scriptive things (Robin Bernstein), and prop theory (Andrew Sofer). The course will use their theories as lenses on the objects of our own research, countering the Western historiography through case studies, alternative readings, and in-class presentations. New work from performance studies (Uri McMillian etc.) will also provide current case studies in scholarship. Focusing on theater and performance studies, this class will also draw on sociology, anthropology, the history of technology, and art history.

In this class, &quot;history&quot; is not only a narrative about the past and its interpretations, but a repository of ideas and techniques that can provide students with useful techniques and sources of inspiration for their own practice. In the graduate component of the class, we will take a historiographic approach to this art form that has often veered towards the biographical and the anecdotal. This is not a history of directors, but a history of directing. That does not mean that we won't look at the work of individual artists: we will do that, while keeping in mind the historical, social, economic as well as aesthetic circumstances under which directing evolved as a distinct profession in the theater.",

The list could go on: homeless, prostitutes, mentally ill, laborers, disabled. Historically, the center stage of Western theater has been reserved for a certain kind of identity: mostly male, mostly upper class, heterosexual, and white European. At the same time, the wings have been teeming with a great diversity of characters. This class focuses on Western cultures' production of its own marginal identities and the role theater in regulating and reintegrating them into society. In this class, we will focus on primary sources, which is to say, on plays. A few of them are canonical, but many of them are not. This investigation of theater's margins will take us to commercial theater, experimental stages, and to the very limits of what is considered 'Western' drama.",

We will examine the relationship between state laws and kinship obligations in Sophocles's Antigone. We will trace the transnational circulation of this text and its adaptations in Gambaro's Argentinian Antigona Furiosa, and Fugard and Kani's South African The Island.  We will read Shakespeare's Othello and consider questions of racism, misogyny, and intimate partner violence, investigate the reverberations of these themes in the OJ Simpson trial, and explore its afterlife in Toni Morrison's Desdemona. We will take up questions of sexual violence via John Patrick Shanley's Doubt and Ariel Dorfman's Chilean classic, Death and the Maiden. We will examine themes of police brutality and racial vulnerability in Anna Deavere Smith's Twilight and Aleshea Harris's What to Send Up When it Goes Down. Through close readings of plays, we will explore the inter-articulation of intimacy and violence, intimidation and transgression, vengeance and forgiveness within the context of larger struggles for gender and racial justice. We will read plays in light of contemporary reckonings with the US criminal justice system: the #MeToo movement and the Black Lives Matter movement. While the former appeals to the criminal justice system to restore victims&iquest; rights, the latter urges a thorough dismantling of the carceral state. How do we understand these divergent responses to augment or abolish punitive structures? Meets WM requirement for TAPS.",

Did you ever want to create and perform your own show but didn't know how to start? This is your chance. In this course, you will learn techniques for creating your own solo show. nnThe contemporary solo performer is descended from a long line that includes the griots of Africa, the troubadours of medieval Europe, and the solo performance artists of the twentieth century. In this course, we will view examples of historical and contemporary live solo performance and uncover principles and practices that will help us develop our own solo shows.nnThrough exercises in acting, writing, and embodied contemplation, students will learn to discover the stories within and around them, and to give voice(s) to their burning issues in a theatrical form that is intimate, idiosyncratic, and deeply personal. The course will culminate in a workshop performance of solo pieces developed by the students.",

        "description": "Provides an overview of cinema from around the world since 1960, highlighting the cultural, political, and economic forces that have shaped various film movements over the last six decades. Specific topics may vary by term/year/instructor. This term's topic, Queer Cinemas around the World, engages with a range of queer cinematic forms and queer spectatorial practices in different parts of the world, as well as BIPOC media from North America. Through film and video from Kenya, Malaysia, India, The Dominican Republic, China, Brazil, Palestine, Japan, Morocco, the US etc., we will examine varied narratives about trans experience, same-sex desire, LGBTQI2S+ rights, censorship, precarity, and hopefulness. This course will attune us to regional cultural specificities in queer expression and representation, prompting us to move away from hegemonic and homogenizing understandings of queer life and media. Notes: Screenings will be held on Wednesdays at 5:30PM in Oshman Hall. Screening times will vary slightly from week to week.",

Students will read plays and historical texts to broaden and enrich their knowledge of theater history and research. The course takes place during the Fall and Winter quarters, with students attending class every other week. This extended course structure is designed to allow more time for students to work through the course material. The final two sessions in each quarter will be reserved for students to present material of their own interest.nnPlease note: TAPS 301 is a required course for TAPS first-year PhD students. It is designed to prepare them for the comprehensive exam, which takes place at the end of the Winter quarter. Other students are welcome to take the course as a regular theater history seminar. Regardless, students should treat the course as one integrated sequence and enroll in both quarters (not just one or the other). nnnThe course will be graded Pass/Fail for first-year TAPS PhD students taking the exam; any other students may take the course as Pass/Fail or for a letter grade at the discretion of the instructor.",

It blends rigorous discussion and theoretical exploration with practical experience in libraries, museums, and other local archival repositories.  Throughout the course, we will explore representation, memory, repertoire, and narrative through examples in theatre and performance history.  We will examine how events have been historicized, how absence has been represented, and how individuals are remembered and refigured.  Important principles and practices of documentation will also be addressed throughout our discussions and activities.  Our discussions and field trips will examine the status of data and various forms of evidence in constructing critical performance history (including prompt scripts, set designs, costumes, publicity material and other ephemera, actorly life-writing, video and digital documents, artifacts, visual material, and embodied traces). TAPS 311 also functions as a gateway course for TAPS PhD students in your first quarter of study at Stanford, familiarizing you with resources at the university and in the broader Bay Area.",

We will consider the ways in which theories of performance have offered generative discursive frameworks for the study of identities, variously shaped by vectors of race, gender, sexuality, religion, class, nation, ethnicity, among others. How is identity as a social category different from identity as a unique and personal attribute of selfhood? Throughout the course we will focus on the inter-locking ways in which certain dimensions of identity become salient at particular historical conjunctures. In addition, we will consider the complex discourses of identity within transnational and historical frameworks. Readings include Robin Bernstein, Ann Pellegrini, Tavia Nyong'o, Jose Munoz, Michael Taussig, Wendy Brown, Talal Asad, Jasbir Puar, among others.

For example, more often than not a good director or a good choreographer is also a good dramaturg: an ability to analyze, adapt, and transform an existing dramatic text or weave devised actions into a narrative is essential for the success of a performance; likewise, acting becomes greatly enriched by performers' ability to grasp internal workings of a dramatic text; finally, any kind of design (stage, costume, light, or digital) benefits from skillful plotting of the story through images and sounds. In this class, students will get acquainted with theoretical and historical sources of dramaturgy and explore procedures and techniques they can use in their work on productions.",

We will focus on two main approaches to the relationship between performance and ethnography: ethnography of performance, a field of ethnographic research that takes cultural performance as its object of investigation; and performance ethnography or performed ethnography, which privileges embodied enactment as a mode of cultural inquiry and employs techniques of theatrical presentation to represent research findings. Alongside weekly readings, in-class presentations, and online and in-person discussions and workshops, students will pursue a mini ethnographic research project that will culminate in a written essay with the option of a performance presentation.",

In exploring the work of scholar-artists who are working in theater and performance, we will ask what are some of the principles, methods, and procedures artists are using in their studios that can be productively employed in scholarly work, and vice versa: how scholarly research can support and engage the process of artistic creation. Interdisciplinarity thrives on collaboration, so accordingly, we will make efforts to explore the modes of collaborative scholarly work. In doing that we will try to perform, rather than just study and observe, the intersection between theory and practice in our discipline.",

In the House of Representatives, the situation is even bleaker: while some ten representatives, out of 435, have experience in some kind of artistic practice (music, writing, or video design), again only one holds an art-related degree. On state level, the situation is better, but not much. Is this severe under-representation of artists among elected officials the result of their lack of interest in institutional position of the arts? How would arts policies in the US look if more elected officials had background in the arts and actual stakes in this sector? 'Counter-Institution' brings together artistic practice and policy. On the one hand, we will explore the 'institutional critique' of artists such as Andrea Fraser, Hito Steyerl, and Fred Wilson, and on the other, we will investigate government initiatives that affected the arts, from the New Deal in the 1930s to the severe defunding of the National Endowment for the Arts in the 1990s, to increasing privatization of art institutions in the first decades of the new millennium.",

Defining performance as &quot;forms of cultural staging,&quot; from Thomas DeFrantz and Anita Gonzalez's Black Performance Theory, this course takes up scripted plays, live theatre, devised works, performance art, and cinematic performance in its survey of the field. We will engage with theorists, performer, artists, and revolutionaries such as Ignatius Sancho, Maria Stewart, William Wells Brown, Zora Neale Hurston, Derek Walcott, Danai Gurira, and Yvonne Orji.  We will address questions around Black identity, history, time, and futurity, as well as other essential strategies Black performers have engaged in their performance making. The course includes essential methodological readings for Black Studies as well as formational writings in Black performance theory and theatre studies.  Students will establish a foothold in both AAAS (theory &amp; methodology) and in performance history (plays and performances). As a WIM course, students will gain expertise in devising, drafting, and revising written essays.",

        "description": "In 2013, CaShawn Thompson devised a Twitter hashtag, #blackgirlmagic, to celebrate the beauty and intelligence of black women. Twitter users quickly adopted the slogan, using the hashtag to celebrate everyday moments of beauty, accomplishment, and magic.  The slogan offered a contemporary iteration of an historical alignment: namely, the concept of &quot;magic&quot; with both Black people as well as &quot;blackness.&quot;  This course explores the legacy of Black magic--and black magic--through performance texts including plays, poetry, films, and novels.  We will investigate the creation of magical worlds, the discursive alignment of magic with blackness, and the contemporary manifestation of a historical phenomenon. We will cover, through lecture and discussion, the history of black magic representation as well as the relationship between magic and religion. Our goal will be to understand the impact and history of discursive alignments:  what relationship does &quot;black magic&quot; have to and for &quot;black bodies&quot;?  How do we understand a history of performance practice as being caught up in complicated legacies of suspicion, celebration, self-definition? The course will give participants a grounding in black performance texts, plays, and theoretical writings. *This course will also satisfy the TAPS department WIM requirement.*",

The author of Orientalism and world-changing frameworks such as Travelling Theory, Permission To Narrate, and Contrapuntal Reading, as well as remarkable texts, such as On Late Style and Representations of the Intellectual, teaches us how criticism can blunt instruments of empire.  In this course, students observe the journey of one scholar as he writes between worlds against imperialist supremacy and colonial logic.

Although the seminar emphasizes a close reading of the tragedies themselves, secondary sources include selections from Homer, Thucydides, Aristophanes, Aristotle, Hegel, and Nietzsche, as well as modern and contemporary classical scholars (Jebb, Dodds, Segal, Taplin, Goldhill, Nussbaum, Easterling, Foley, Seidensticker, Griffiths, Rehm, Wiles, Hall, Budelmann, and others). The seminar assigns the plays in English translation, but students with ancient Greek are encouraged to enroll, and accommodations can be made to attend to their interests. Plays include Persians, Prometheus Bound, the Oresteia trilogy (Aeschylus); Antigone, Oedipus, Oedipus at Colonus, Electra, and Philoctetes (Sophocles); and Medea, Heracles, Electra, Ion, Helen, and Bacchae (Euripides).",

        "description": "Traditionally, courses on Palestinians focus on political histories and narratives of two nationalisms vying for uncontested statehood in the Levant. Humanists, artists, and social scientists have explored the political, military, sociological, and religious roots of the modern Middle East from many worthy perspectives that can be found in landmark texts by prolific scholars. However, most of these scholars and the majority of university level courses on the subject of the Palestinians have not paid significant attention to their contributions in the arena of cultural production, particularly in theatre and film. This seminar explores cultural artifacts produced by, for, and on behalf of Palestinians. Throughout the quarter, students will be exposed to foundational texts in the area as well as a number of key films and theatrical plays. The selected works sometimes correspond to historical events, but not always. On occasion, the works function as witness accounts by presenting multiple viewpoints and rich artistically created contexts. The class offers students the opportunity to engage with Palestinians while simultaneously considering foundational relevant concepts in the areas of nationalism, race studies, and postcolonialism. We will aspire to ask useful questions that may help us better understand how and why Palestinians produce performance cultures.",

Among other topics, we will revisit the debates about autonomous and committed art, emancipatory potential of performance, and live performance in relation to an increasingly automatized sociality.

Based on the enrolment in the class, the students will be cast in one (or more) of the following plays: As Soon As Impossible by Betty Shamieh, My Arab by Samer Al-Saber, and Writing Fragments Home by Jeffrey Lo. If needed, the instructors will expand these selections to include other plays. By the end of this course, students will have first-hand experience in the development of news plays, involving rigorous work as a production team for Zoom readings, with a focus on acting, dramaturgy, and conceptual design. Students are expected to rehearse outside the assigned class time and to report back to the instructors based on rehearsal prompts and tailored assignments. Each play will receive a virtual staged reading, followed by comments from the class, and a re-worked reading. Students will be involved in all the plays as actors (sometimes double-cast), dramaturgs, assistant directors, and virtual designers. Graduate student enrollment by permission.

        "description": "With its' lush and fantastic landscape, fabulous carnivalesque aesthetics, and rich African Diaspora Religious traditions, the Caribbean has long been a setting which New World black artists have staged competing visions of racial and sexual utopia and dystopia. However, these foreigner-authored fantasies have often overshadowed the lived experience and life storytelling of Caribbean subjects. This course explores the intersecting performance cultures, politics, and sensual/sexual practices that have constituted queer life in the Caribbean region and its diaspora. Placing Caribbean queer of color critique alongside key moments in twentieth and twenty-first century performance history at home and abroad, we will ask how have histories of the plantation, discourses of race and nation, migration, and revolution led to the formation of regionally specific queer identifications. What about the idea of the 'tropics' has made it such as fertile ground for queer performance making, and how have artists from the region identified or dis-identified with these aesthetic formations? This class will begin with an exploration of theories of queer diaspora and queer of color critique's roots in black feminisms. We will cover themes of exile, religious rites, and organizing as sights of queer political formation and creative community in the Caribbean.",

        "description": "What does it mean to dance black? How can studying comparative dance practices across the United States and the Caribbean expose continuities and differences in African diaspora experience? How can we draw strategies from black performance to inform our current movements for social change? This class will explore how dance and writing about performance have shaped notions of what it means to identify or be marked as an African diaspora subject. From the ring shouts of captive Africans to the 20th-century concert dance stage, from New York queer ballroom culture to Tiktok fads, this class will expose students to both historical and ethnographic methods for using dance to study the formation of black community in the New World. Looking beyond the surface of skin, we'll explore how race is experienced in muscle and flesh, and how black performers have historically taken advantage of or disavowed racialized ideas of how they can/should move. We will read theories of diaspora, queer of color critique and black feminist theory, and performance theory. We will search for the common questions and conversations about embodiment, the spectator's gaze, and black belonging that run through all three disciplines. Students will be required to do some movement research (through accessible, at-home dance practice), write weekly journals, and complete short essay projects. Students develop will skills for writing, speaking, and making performance to explore the intersections between race, sexuality, and dance.",

        "description": "The past year has witnessed a remarkable reckoning with systemic racism and embedded structures of inequality, underscoring once again the epistemic violence of the privileging of a white, western, heteropatriarchal intellectual tradition in the academy. This seminar mobilizes multiple approaches and orientations, including decolonial theory, the Black Radical Tradition, postcolonial theory, and transnational decolonial feminisms. We consider critiques from these traditions of the Eurocentrism of critical theory, its imbrication with western modernity, colonial capitalism, and neocolonial geopolitics. Through texts ranging across frameworks of the coloniality of gender, epistemologies of the South, critical race studies, and theories of the global, we examine ways to de-universalize, de-imperialize, decolonize, and globalize Theory. Limited to graduate students; undergraduates must contact instructor for permission (seniors only).The seminar can be taken for less than 5 units only under extenuating circumstances. Contact instructor in such cases for permission.",
