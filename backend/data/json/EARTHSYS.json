Why are there rolling hills to the west behind Stanford and soaring granite walls to the east in Yosemite? What was the Earth like in the past, and what will it be like in the future? Lectures, hands-on laboratories, in-class activities, and one virtual field trip will help you see the Earth through the eyes of a geologist. Topics include plate tectonics, the cycling and formation of different types of rocks, and how geologists use rocks to understand Earth's history.

        "description": "This seminar will explore the crucial role of the Columbia River in the past, present, and future of the Pacific Northwest. Topics will include the lives and legacies of the indigenous peoples that Lewis and Clark encountered more than two centuries ago; the historic fisheries that attracted thousands of Chinese and, later, Scandinavian workers; the New Deal&iquest;s epic dam-building initiatives beginning in the 1930s; the impact of the Manhattan Project&iquest;s plutonium bomb development at Hanford Atomic Works in WWII; and the twenty-first-century server farms dotted across the Columbia Plateau. We plan to visit with local water managers, farmers, ranchers, loggers, Native American fishermen, and energy administrators, as well as elected officials and environmental activists, to examine the hydrologic, meteorologic, and geologic bases of the river&iquest;s water and energy resources, and the practical, social, environmental, economic, and political issues surrounding their development in the Pacific Northwest region.The Columbia River and its watershed provide a revealing lens on a host of issues. A transnational, multi-state river with the largest residual populations of anadromous salmonids in the continental US, it is a major source of renewable hydroelectric power. (The Grand Coulee dam powerhouse is the largest-capacity hydropower facility in the US; nearly 50% of Oregon&iquest;s electricity generation flows from hydropower; in Washington State it&iquest;s nearly two-thirds, the highest in the nation.)  The river provides a major bulk commodity transportation link from the interior West to the sea via an elaborate system of locks. It irrigates nearly 700,000 acres of sprawling wheat ranches and fruit farms in the federally administered Columbia Basin Project. We will look at all these issues with respect to rapid climate change, ecosystem impacts, economics, and public policy.We will begin with classroom briefings on campus, in preparation for the two-week field portion of the seminar.  We plan to then travel widely throughout the Columbia basin, visiting water and energy facilities across the watershed, e.g., hydro, solar, wind, and natural gas power plants; dams and reservoirs with their powerhouses, fish passage facilities, navigation locks, and flood-mitigation systems; tribal organizations; irrigation projects; the Hanford Nuclear Reservation; and offices of regulatory agencies.  We hope to meet with relevant policy experts and public officials, along with several of the stakeholders in the basin.Over the summer students will be responsible for assigned readings from several sources, including monographs, online materials, and recent news articles.  During the trip, students will work in small groups to analyze and assess one aspect of the river&iquest;s utilization, and the challenges to responsible management going forward.  The seminar will culminate in presentations to an audience of Stanford alumni in Portland, Oregon.",

        "description": "This interactive, seminar-style course explores the intersection of environmental sustainability and athletics. Athletic endeavors provide a unique lens to analyze environmental sustainability due to their global reach, engaged fan bases and widely popular sport icons. At the same time, the athletics industry produces an enormous environmental footprint with its travel, events, venue construction and maintenance, high protein diets, global supply chains for equipment, gear and even swag.  Because of this reality, the sports industry has the opportunity and responsibility to create meaningful change in support of a sustainable future. We will explore the many ways that the athletics industry can make this change by inviting weekly speakers from a multitude of sports realms to share their expertise, vision and advice. There will be six learning modules addressing sustainability in terms of athletic gear and equipment, sports nutrition, facilities and stadiums, game days and events, the national and international stage, and individual sustainability superstars. Through taking this course, students will develop an understanding for the current state of athletic sustainability as well as future directions and opportunities for the industry in this space. They also get to undertake a real project on campus to further Stanford&iquest;s commitment to sustainability as a purposeful university. The one unit option focusses on the weekly speakers, reading reflections and a final presentation, where the two unit option incorporates a sustainability in athletics project on campus.  A project deliverable and presentation will serve as the culmination of this course.",

        "description": "Where does the food you eat come from? How does it get to your plate? Where does it go when you don't finish it? And why are those particular items on your plate in the first place? How and what we eat is a vastly overlooked part of everyday life, and yet comes with huge personal, societal, and environmental effects, both positive and (quite often) negative. But this isn't indicative of personal moral failings or ignorance - rather, the food system was designed this way. And it leaves many of us without choice or consent around what we put into our bodies and how our actions impact those around us, thereby exacerbating social and health inequities. This class will uncover the secret workings of the global food system and introduce students to movements and efforts towards creating a more just food future for all. We will center on the concept of 'food justice,' which includes all ideas and practices that strive to eliminate exploitation and oppression within and beyond the food system. This trajectory will take us through understandings of economic, political, cultural, social, and ecological life, both now and in the past, providing students with a unique opportunity to gain interdisciplinary knowledge of food systems. For instance, we will learn about how historical and modern-day activists and scholars draw on movements for economic, gender, racial, climate, and environmental justice, and explore the possibilities for both reformative and transformative food politics. Finally, because food production, consumption, and activism are all highly tangible practices, the class will engage in field trips to the Stanford O'Donohue Family Farm, Stanford Food Institute's Teaching Kitchen, and a local Bay Area farm to get hands-on experience with what it means to eat more ethically.",

How do we compel action from an individual to a national level when the facts alone aren&iquest;t enough?  In this class you will learn the basic tools of science communication through the lens of natural hazards such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and extreme weather.  You will learn the basics of the science that drives these hazards, and how to communicate that science to different audiences. Recent research has shown that relaying scientific knowledge alone to potentially vulnerable populations does not have a significant impact on increasing their resilience to those hazards. Therefore, it is increasingly important to train a new generation of science communicators and translators who can effectively relay complex information in engaging and understandable ways.  This will be a hands-on course where you will be working individually and in small groups to discuss class topics, share, and peer review each other&iquest;s writing each week.

These decisions will depend on considerations of cost per energy unit, resource availability, and unique national policy needs.  Less often considered is the environmental impact of the different energy producing systems: fossil fuels, nuclear, wind, solar, and other alternatives.  One of the challenges has been not only to evaluate the environmental impact but also to develop a systematic basis for comparison of environmental impact among the energy sources.  The course will consider fossil fuels (natural gas, petroleum and coal), nuclear power, wind and solar and consider the impact of resource extraction, refining and production, transmission and utilization for each energy source.

Answering it calls for both scientific and experiential understanding of Earth processes, as well as how geologic thinking and our individual thinking about nature have changed through time. By connecting Earth processes and rates of transformations to personal experience, we can rigorously interrogate our relationship to and/or separation from Earth.In this course, you will think like a philosopher and a geochemist. You will commune with nature and calculate the history of rocks. You will use real data analysis of Earth processes to understand the limits of our knowledge about Earth history (Deep Time). You will explore your interactions with Earth materials through mindfulness activities and discuss different views of humans relative to nature through history. You will have autonomy in a course-long project that synthesizes your growing understanding of your relationship to and/or separation from Earth.This course welcomes all, from rock collectors to hikers and ecofeminists to meditators. No prior experience with philosophy or Earth science is required, though an introductory high school chemistry and algebra course will be helpful. The only requirement is a willingness to examine your personal relationship with Earth from scientific and humanistic perspectives.",

Energy is also a fundamental driver of human development and opportunity. In taking this course, students will not only understand the fundamentals of each energy resource - including significance and potential, conversion processes and technologies, drivers and barriers, policy and regulation, and social, economic, and environmental impacts - students will also be able to put this in the context of the broader energy system. Both depletable and renewable energy resources are covered, including oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear, biomass and biofuel, hydroelectric, wind, solar thermal and photovoltaics (PV), geothermal, and ocean energy, with cross-cutting topics including electricity, storage, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), sustainability, green buildings, energy efficiency, transportation, and the developing world. The 4 unit course includes lecture and in-class discussion, readings and videos, homework assignments, one on-campus field trip during lecture time and two off-campus field trips with brief report assignments. Off-campus field trips to wind farms, solar farms, nuclear power plants, natural gas power plants, hydroelectric dams, etc. Enroll for 5 units to also attend the Workshop, an interactive discussion section on cross-cutting topics that meets once per week for 80 minutes (Mondays, 12:30 PM - 1:50 PM). Open to all: pre-majors and majors, with any background!

Working with a water agency in the San Joaquin Valley, we will explore feedback loops between the two Acts and develop a plan for water management that meet the co-equal objectives of sustainable and equitable resource governance. We will work with &quot;big&quot; and &quot;small&quot; data, exploring the possibilities but also the limitations of using publicly available data for assessment and monitoring.

        "description": "This lecture and discussion course will review the scientific evidence on the use and impacts of genetic engineering in global food and agricultural systems. The class will cover the history and details of crop genetic improvement, ranging from primitive domestication to CRISPR technologies. We will examine the risks and benefits of crop genetic technologies in agriculture with regards to productivity, farm incomes, food safety, human health and nutrition, and environmental impacts. We will also discuss the current and future use of genetic engineering techniques for enhancing climate resilience and nutritional outcomes in agricultural systems worldwide. Finally, we will discuss the ethics of using modern genetic approaches for crop improvement, and the policy environment surrounding the use of these genetic techniques.Our expectation is that students enrolled in the course will attend all class sections and participate actively in the discussions. Students will be asked to identify peer-reviewed, scientific papers on the impacts of specific crop genetic improvements. Depending on the class size, students will also be asked to help lead class discussions. At the end of the course, students will work in groups to debate a selected topic on the use of genetic engineering in agriculture, to be announced during the course.Prerequisites: One course in biology and one course in economics are suggested. Completion of &quot;Feeding Nine Billion&quot; and &quot;The World Food Economy&quot; classes would also be helpful, as would a class in genetics, but there are no strict course requirements.",

        "description": "Desert environments make up a third of the land areas on Earth, ranging from the hottest to the coldest environments.  Aridity leads to the development of unique adaptations among the organisms that inhabit them.  Climate change and other processes of desertification as well as increasing human demand for habitable and cultivatable areas have resulting in increasing need to better understand these systems.  Namibia is a model system for studying these processes and includes the Sossuvlei (Sand Sea) World Heritable Site.  This seminar will prepare students for their overseas field experience in Namibia.  The seminar will provide an introduction to desert biogeography and culture, using Namibia as a case study.  During the seminar, students will each give two presentations on aspects of desert biogeography and ecology, specific organisms and their adaptations to arid environments, cultural adaptations of indigenous peoples and immigrants, ecological threats and conservation efforts, and/or national and international policy towards deserts. Additional assignments include a comprehensive dossier and a final exam.  Students will also carry out background research for the presentations they will be giving during the field seminar where access to the internet and to other scholarly resources will be limited. In addition, we will cover logistics, health and safety, cultural sensitivity, geography, and politics.  We will deal with post-field issues such as reverse culture shock, and ways in which participants can consolidate and build up their abroad experiences after they return to campus.",

Building on the success of earlier housing justice policy lab initiatives, this course will support ongoing policy engagement in local land use planning process, including housing and transportation justice issues. Key concepts addressed will include environmental justice (EJ) and just transitions frameworks, as well as building awareness of the Bay Area housing crisis. The course will culminate in class projects that will involve working with community partners to address information gaps on worker experiences and housing and transportation needs. We will meet for a weekly 3-hour session. Sessions will prioritize 1) foundational concepts in environmental justice 2) current issues in our community related to housing, transportation, and labor equity, 2) peer learning through collective engagement in readings and project planning, 4) community connections related to SCoPE initiatives that deepen existing relationships, and 5) policy analysis related to local land use planning processes.

        "description": "Historically, discussions of race, ethnicity, culture, and equity in the environment have been shaped by a limited view of the environmental justice movement, often centered on urban environmental threats and separated from other types of environmental and climate advocacy. This course will seek to expand on these discussions by exploring topics such as access to outdoor spaces, definitions of wilderness, inclusion in environmental organizations, gender and the outdoors, the influence of colonialism on ways of knowing, food justice and ethics, and the future of climate change policy. The course will also involve a community partnership project. In small groups students will work with an environmental organization to problem-solve around issues of equity, representation, and access. We value a diversity of experiences and epistemologies and welcome undergraduates from all disciplines. Since this is a practical course, there will be a strong emphasis on participation and commitment to community partnerships.

In response, waste has also become a productive concept in the environmental humanities and humanistic social sciences. In this course we will read a selection of foundational texts focused on waste, many of which draw on case studies from different parts of the world. The case of China will be emphasized, however, since China has emerged in the last few decades as a center not only of global industrial production, but also for processing the world&iquest;s waste, contesting pollution, and fighting for environmental justice. By pairing key theoretical texts with texts dealing with waste-related issues in China and elsewhere, we will ultimately ask how contemporary global waste politics disrupts western understandings of waste, recycling, value, and more.",

        "description": "The world is changing in contradictory ways. Emerging technology, the evolving geopolitical economy, and ecological challenges present opportunities but also cascading risks. The pathway from our current destructive and extractive economy towards a more regenerative economy is unclear. There is a stark tension between gigascale opportunities such as AI, fusion energy, nanotech, quantum tech, space colonization, and biomanufacturing on the one hand, and degrowth necessities such as rethinking growth and using less resources on the other. This tension is steeped in political choices constrained by industrial power dynamics and conditioned by inequality. To what extent do visions and incentives align across industry, government, and social movements? What would the choice to scale or descale entail in each case - and are they mutually exclusive? The course introduces empirically driven systems thinking with in-depth modules on both emerging tech and degrowth, and scenario-based tech foresight. We combine the tools of technology foresight, gaming, scenarios, speculative fiction, and worldbuilding, exploring and assessing utopian or dystopian trends, visions, and projects (e.g. the Eden project, biomanufacturing at scale, smart cities, the Metaverse, generation spaceships, space colonization, human longevity, mega-disruptive startups, global health governance, radical longtermism, and religious `heavens'). The goal of the course is to gain clarity on the innovation boundaries within which the next 50 years might develop. The course prepares students to become disruptors of governance principles, strategies, and leadership of corporations, philanthropies, economies, and civilizations.",

Throughout history humans have used maps to share what they know, make sense of the world, and navigate the challenges ahead&quot; (ESRI UC, 2022). Our world is a complex and highly interdependent system rapidly changing and evolving, impacted by climate change and anthropogenic activity. The accelerated growth of geospatial data science has integrated many innovations, expanded capabilities, and created new insights which can address the numerous challenges of the twenty-first century. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provides a powerful platform for imagining and creating solutions, while expanding our ability to identify patterns and relationships to better understand the world around us. This introductory course will explore the principles and practical applications of geospatial data science. Students will learn how to adopt a geographic approach, and gain expertise in spatial analysis and statistics, remote sensing, and cartographic visualization. They will learn to identify, acquire, and modify datasets, which will enable them to design and develop models to solve spatial problems. Course topics will cover local, regional, and even global scale applications of GIS in natural resource management, conservation, urban planning, land systems science, climate change, and environmental monitoring. The course structure consists of weekly lectures, guest speakers, computer lab assignments, midterm and final examinations as well as an individual final project requirement.",

We will interrogate these questions through the work of influential, diverse, primarily American environmental writers who have given voice to many ways of knowing the wonder, fragility, complexity, and power of the natural world and have inspired readers to act on behalf of social-environmental causes. This course centers the work of diverse voices, including Indigenous, Black, and Chicana writers, enabling us to consider some of the many ways that people have understood and experienced nature throughout history and the relevance of these manifold ways of knowing to our conceptualizations of nature today. Students will develop their responses to the question of what is the wild and why it matters through a series of synchronous and asynchronous in-the-field writing exercises that integrate personal narrative and environmental scholarship, culminating in a ~3000-word narrative nonfiction essay. This course will provide students with knowledge, tools, experience, and skills that will empower them to become more persuasive environmental storytellers and advocates.If you are interested in signing up for the course, complete this pre-registration form:https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9XqZeZs036WIvop",

In this course students will develop an increased understanding of how different stakeholders including scientists, aid organizations, locals, policy makers, activists, and media professionals communicate the climate change crisis. They will select a site experiencing the devastating effects and research the voices telling the stories of those sites and the audiences who are (or are not) listening. Students might want to investigate drought-ridden areas such as the Central Valley of California or Darfur, Sudan; Alpine glaciers melting in the Alps or in Alaska; the increasingly flooded Pacific islands; the hurricane ravaged Gulf Coast, among many others. Data from various stakeholders will be analyzed and synthesized for a magazine length article designed to bring attention to a region and/or issue that has previously been neglected. Students will write and submit their article for publication.For students who have completed the first two levels of the writing requirement and want further work in developing writing abilities, especially within discipline-specific contexts and nonfiction genres. Individual conferences with instructor and peer workshops. Prerequisite: first two levels of the writing requirement or equivalent transfer credit.

Seemingly distinct large-scale risks affect what we now realize are mutually interdependent human, socio-technical, and ecological systems. As a result, consequences are more catastrophic, and costs are set to accelerate. How do we determine the top risks of this decade to prioritize actions, and how are both risks and actions likely to evolve and interact? This course investigates the data, methods, and insights mobilized by key actors such as corporations, governments, and academics to assess systemic risk, create future scenarios, and generate predictions. What are the track records of recognized systemic risk assessment and modeling toolkits? Going forward, how can we get better at risk prevention and mitigation? This year, the course will focus on combined risks from the environmental, health, and emerging tech domains. The key objective is to quickly learn relevant vocabularies (risk, tech, and futurist) by engaging with both traditional and emerging assessment methods, in order to discover how to shape positive societal outcomes in the next decade and beyond. The course prepares students for key roles in the assessment, management, and prediction of risks, technologies, markets, industries, infrastructures, and futures.

Only when traffic piles up, the subway shuts down, or the sidewalk is closed do we notice the services and infrastructure that are critical to everyday movement.

This course will interrogate the role of transportation in fostering sustainable communities paying particular attention to how policy and planning decisions contribute to or hinder equitable access, economic vibrancy, environmental protection. Through a combination of lectures, field work, guest speakers, and real-world client projects, this course will provide an introduction to the field of transportation policy and planning.

        "description": "This course explores the science of valuing nature, through two interwoven pathways. One is biophysical, focused on human dependence and impacts on Earth's life-support systems. If well managed, lands, waters, and biodiversity yield a flow of vital benefits that sustain and fulfill human life. We will develop a framework and practical tools for quantifying this stream of benefits from nature to people. The second pathway is social, economic, and philosophical, weaving through concepts of well-being, human development, and conservation and the ethics and effects of their pursuit. We will look back, ahead into the future, and inward, taking a global view and considering diverse cultural perspectives. Our discussions will be situated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, movements for racial justice and socioeconomic equity, and efforts to enable people and nature to thrive in cities and countries worldwide. The course is intended for diverse, advanced students, with interests in research and in moving from science to action for a more just and sustainable world. Prerequisite: Basic to intermediate GIS (Geographic Information Systems) skills are necessary. We will help with these, but not teach GIS specifically in class. Basic skills include, for example: working with raster, vector and tabular data; loading rasters, shapefiles, and tables into a GIS; changing the symbology of rasters and shapefiles in your chosen GIS; editing raster and shapefile attribute tables; understanding coordinate systems and how to re-project layers; looking at individual raster cell values; and performing basic raster math.",

        "description": "Adaptation is the process by which organisms or societies become better suited to their environments. In this class, we will explore three distinct but related notions of adaptation. Biological adaptations arise through natural selection, while cultural adaptations arise from a variety of processes, some of which closely resemble natural selection. A newer notion of adaptation has emerged in the context of climate change where adaptation takes on a highly instrumental, and often planned, quality as a response to the negative impacts of environmental change. We will discuss each of these ideas, using their commonalities and subtle differences to develop a broader understanding of the dynamic interplay between people and their environments. Topics covered will include, among others: evolution, natural selection, levels of selection, formal models of cultural evolution, replicator dynamics, resilience, rationality and its limits, complexity, adaptive management.",

There are many tough choices to be made- on fertilizers, groundwater pumping, pesticide use, organics, genetic modification, etc. Unfortunately, many people form strong opinions about these issues before understanding some of the basics of how food is grown, such as how most farmers currently manage their fields, and their reasons for doing so. The goal of this class is to present an overview of global agriculture, and the tradeoffs involved with different practices. Students will develop two key knowledge bases: basic principles of crop ecology and agronomy, and familiarity with the scale of the global food system. The last few weeks of the course will be devoted to building on this knowledge base to evaluate different future directions for agriculture.",

        "description": "This colloquium brings the voices and vision of leading Environmental Justice (EJ) advocates to the Stanford community, in order to educate, inspire, and transform our understanding of environmental science.  Environmental Justice advances a positive vision for policies and actions that fight environmental racism. EJ approaches involve centering the voices and leadership of marginalized communities in 1) ensuring equitable access to environmental benefits, and 2) preventing or mitigating the disproportionate impacts of environmental harms for all communities, regardless of gender, class, race, ethnicity, or other social positions. This colloquium highlights the work of leading EJ thinkers and practitioners, speaking from frontline organizations on a wide range of topics. These topics include acting on toxic exposures and health disparities for community resilience, climate justice and youth action, Indigenous land and water rights, green cities and Afrofuturism, food justice and intersecting social movements, queer ecologies, and more. The colloquium will host a weekly speaker with course meetings held every Wednesday. Colloquium presentations will begin promptly at 12pm.",

        "description": "The Environmental Justice and Human Rights Lab is an intellectual hub and supportive learning community for students engaging in environmental justice and human rights work of any kind. Environmental justice (EJ) advances a positive vision for policies and actions that fight environmental racism, and human rights (HR) center on the notion that all people, by virtue of their existence and regardless of any given status or classification, are equally entitled to fundamental rights and protections. Our semi-structured weekly sessions will foster an open learning environment for students and peer-to-peer learning connections. Sessions will include giving and receiving feedback on capstone or community-based projects, independent research, or other relevant coursework or extracurricular activity. We also welcome students who are new to these topics and would like to learn more. We are open to students of all backgrounds and disciplines at any stage of their research or project work. Following EJ and HR principles, we seek to center local, contextualised knowledge and leadership through ethical research partnerships with community members. To do so, we follow community-based participatory research approaches and decolonizing methodologies. Examples of our work to date include 1) enabling graduate students to effectively bring EJ and HR approaches into dissertation research, 2) supporting campus leaders and directly participating in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, and 3) educating and learning from one another about critical EJ and HR scholarship and anti-racist approaches to our work. Lab interests include addressing inequitable impacts of climate change, advancing decolonial approaches to land and water management, promoting food justice, combatting human trafficking and labor exploitation, promoting fair and just immigration policies, and additional EJ and HR research topics. Note that this lab is intended as an open space for engagement. If you are unable to enroll for credit, but would still like to participate, please email humanrights@stanford.edu.",

        "description": "Much public discourse that touches upon the relationship of human society to the natural environment acknowledges the fundamental connection between people and the environment, but avoids or simplifies discussion of broader philosophical and political views of what this relationship is, has been, and ought to be. Expansive conceptual categories of the study of politics, economics, and society, such as capitalism, socialism, democracy, human welfare, and distribution, are often left out entirely, or used quickly and not defined clearly. In thinking big about human society and the natural world, what is ideal, and what is possible? This once-weekly seminar aims to help students develop the breadth and depth of their thinking about the relationship of human society to nature at the level of political, social, and economic philosophy. It will provide an organized setting for the understanding and critical discussion of these abstract but sometimes world-shaping ideas. Particular attention will be paid to the wide range of such views put forth in recent history, the various assumptions built into each view, and to the differing levels of influence and political effectiveness achieved by each. Discussions will be based on a weekly reading from a philosophically oriented work about humanity and the environment, such as a book chapter or a piece of long-form journalism. Grading/credit based on weekly participation and a short reflective paper.",

The pathway that water takes from rainfall to the irrigation of fields or household taps ('the water course') determines the quantity and quality of the available water. Working with various data sources (measurements made on the ground, in wells, and from satellites) allows us to model the water budget in the valley and explore the recent impacts on freshwater supplies.",

        "description": "The challenges of addressing climate change and sustainability require urgency as well as innovative solutions. Startups operate with speed and urgency, 24/7. In recent years they have learned not only how to effectively innovate but also how to be extremely efficient with resources and time, using lean startup methods. Participants in this class develop the skills required of a mission driven entrepreneur by tackling a critical problem in climate and sustainability as part of a team of engineers, scientists, social scientists, MBAs, and law and policy experts. Teams will engage pressing climate and sustainability problems and learn how to apply lean startup principles (&quot;business model canvas,&quot; &quot;customer development,&quot; and &quot;agile engineering&quot;) in developing solutions. Students will take a hands-on, experiential approach to explore options for solutions and needs for stakeholders. The process of exploring options will require participants to engage deeply and to learn how to work closely with policy makers, technologists, government officials, NGOs, foundations, companies, and others interested in solving these problems, while demanding that teams continually build iterative prototypes to test their understanding of the problem and solution hypotheses. For more information on problems and sponsors as they are added and to apply for the course, see&nbsp;https://h4cs.stanford.edu/. Applications required in November.

        "description": "Historically, discussions of race, ethnicity, culture, and equity in the environment have been shaped by a limited view of the environmental justice movement, often centered on urban environmental threats and separated from other types of environmental and climate advocacy. This course will seek to expand on these discussions by exploring topics such as access to outdoor spaces, definitions of wilderness, inclusion in environmental organizations, gender and the outdoors, the influence of colonialism on ways of knowing, food justice and ethics, and the future of climate change policy. The course will also involve a community partnership project. In small groups students will work with an environmental organization to problem-solve around issues of equity, representation, and access. We value a diversity of experiences and epistemologies and welcome undergraduates from all disciplines. Since this is a practical course, there will be a strong emphasis on participation and commitment to community partnerships.

It is an interdisciplinary field that draws upon psychology, economics, political science, and management, among other disciplines. It is being used in a number of domain areas and for a variety of applications, including managing freshwater resources, designing decision support tools to aid in coastal adaptation to sea-level rise, and creating &quot;nudges&quot; to enhance energy efficiency behaviors. This course covers behavioral theories of probabilistic inference, intuitive prediction, preference, and decision making. Topics include heuristics and biases, risk perceptions and attitudes, strategies for combining different sources of information and dealing with conflicting objectives, and the roles of group and emotional processes in decision making. This course will introduce students to foundational theories of decision science, and will involve applying these theories to understand decisions about environmental threats.",

Students will be introduced to a range of methods - from basic to advanced - to characterize population structure, conduct demographic analyses, estimate extinction risk, identify temporal trends and spatial patterns, quantify the effect of environmental determinants and anthropogenic pressures on the dynamics of marine populations, describe the potential for adaptation to climate change. This course will emphasize learning by doing, and will rely heavily on practical computer laboratories, in R and/or Phyton, based on data from our own research activities or peer reviewed publications. Students with a background knowledge of statistics, programming and calculus will be most welcome. Formally BIOHOPK 143H and 243H.",

        "description": "What is the wild? What is our relationship to nature, and why does this relationship matter? We will interrogate these questions through the work of influential, diverse, primarily American environmental writers who have given voice to many ways of knowing the wonder, fragility, complexity, and power of the natural world and have inspired readers to act on behalf of social-environmental causes. This course centers the work of diverse voices, including Indigenous, Black, and Chicana writers, enabling us to consider some of the many ways that people have understood and experienced nature throughout history and the relevance of these manifold ways of knowing to our conceptualizations of nature today. Students will develop their responses to the question of what is the wild and why it matters through a series of synchronous and asynchronous in-the-field writing exercises that integrate personal narrative and environmental scholarship, culminating in a ~3000-word narrative nonfiction essay. This course will provide students with knowledge, tools, experience, and skills that will empower them to become more persuasive environmental storytellers and advocates.If you are interested in signing up for the course, complete this pre-registration form:https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9XqZeZs036WIvop",

How do we build governance institutions that facilitate both environmental sustainability and social equity? This seminar on environmental governance will focus on the challenges and opportunities for managing common-pool resources, like fisheries, forests, and water. Because managing environmental resources is often about managing people, we will explore the motivations underlying human behavior towards the environment. We will discuss how institutions encode our cultural values and beliefs, and how we can reshape these institutions to achieve more sustainable outcomes. Coursework includes foundational readings and a pragmatic exploration of case studies. Teaching cases address topics in community-based conservation, international protected areas, market-based approaches, coping with environmental risk, and other themes. Interested undergraduate and graduate students from any discipline are welcome.",

One is biophysical, focused on human dependence and impacts on Earth's life-support systems. If well managed, lands, waters, and biodiversity yield a flow of vital benefits that sustain and fulfill human life. We will develop a framework and practical tools for quantifying this stream of benefits from nature to people. The second pathway is social, economic, and philosophical, weaving through concepts of well-being, human development, and conservation and the ethics and effects of their pursuit. We will look back, ahead into the future, and inward, taking a global view and considering diverse cultural perspectives. Our discussions will be situated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, movements for racial justice and socioeconomic equity, and efforts to enable people and nature to thrive in cities and countries worldwide. The course is intended for diverse, advanced students, with interests in research and in moving from science to action for a more just and sustainable world. Prerequisite: Basic to intermediate GIS (Geographic Information Systems) skills are necessary. We will help with these, but not teach GIS specifically in class. Basic skills include, for example: working with raster, vector and tabular data; loading rasters, shapefiles, and tables into a GIS; changing the symbology of rasters and shapefiles in your chosen GIS; editing raster and shapefile attribute tables; understanding coordinate systems and how to re-project layers; looking at individual raster cell values; and performing basic raster math.",

The idea is to complete a well-defined, manageable, but important project to a high standard under significant time constraints. Our community partners have requested help with achieving their missions and seminar students will utilize their backgrounds in social/environmental problem solving to deliver a final product. Our partners have requested help with such efforts as grant and report writing, data analysis, curriculum development, symposium organizing, presentation research and preparation and communications to raise awareness about an environmental challenge. If you choose to design your own project, the instructor will help you to create this opportunity. Students will give oral presentations on their project progress throughout the quarter, culminating in a final presentation at a symposium with our partners. Students will also explore how best to communicate their interdisciplinary skills and goals through their resumes, CV's or cover letters, portfolios or linkedIn profiles in preparation for the next phase of their career. Guest speakers and in class workshops will complement these activities.Cardinal Course certified by the Haas Center.",

        "description": "Much public discourse that touches upon the relationship of human society to the natural environment acknowledges the fundamental connection between people and the environment, but avoids or simplifies discussion of broader philosophical and political views of what this relationship is, has been, and ought to be. Expansive conceptual categories of the study of politics, economics, and society, such as capitalism, socialism, democracy, human welfare, and distribution, are often left out entirely, or used quickly and not defined clearly. In thinking big about human society and the natural world, what is ideal, and what is possible? This once-weekly seminar aims to help students develop the breadth and depth of their thinking about the relationship of human society to nature at the level of political, social, and economic philosophy. It will provide an organized setting for the understanding and critical discussion of these abstract but sometimes world-shaping ideas. Particular attention will be paid to the wide range of such views put forth in recent history, the various assumptions built into each view, and to the differing levels of influence and political effectiveness achieved by each. Discussions will be based on a weekly reading from a philosophically oriented work about humanity and the environment, such as a book chapter or a piece of long-form journalism. Grading/credit based on weekly participation and a short reflective paper.",
