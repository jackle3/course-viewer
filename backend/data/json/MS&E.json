        "description": "This course provides a comprehensive overview of strategic, economic and financial issues related to mergers and acquisitions.  Specifically, we review the market for corporate control, discuss strategic issues related to firms' decision to acquire or be acquired, and examine the M&amp;A regulatory environment.  We analyze various valuation and deal structure considerations, identify strategies that underlay a successful negotiation, and review the financial reporting and income tax implications of M&amp;A transactions.In covering these and other related issues, we will discuss both the theory and practice of mergers and acquisitions. To provide some specific context we will analyze many large and small M&amp;A deals. In discussing these cases, we will examine the situation faced by the company, the issues surrounding the transaction, including the financial implications, and focus on the managerial incentives and the judgment applied. Class time comprises mini lectures that introduce some of the more technical concepts, case discussions, and guest speakers who will offer additional perspectives on the subject matters.The course is co-taught by Ron Kasznik (GSB) and Safra Catz (Oracle Corporation). Ms. Catz is the CEO of Oracle Corporation and a member of its Board of Directors. She has led Oracle through more than 100 acquisitions in recent years (including PeopleSoft, Siebel, BEA, Sun Microsystems, and many more). Prior to joining Oracle in 1999, Ms. Catz was Managing Director at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, a global investment bank (now part of CSFB).  Ms. Catz also serves on the board of directors for Walt Disney.",

Approximately 40% of the course will cover the basic scientific and statistical principles, with an emphasis on elements of design and analysis that pose threats to reproducibility; e.g. multiplicity, selective reporting, design effects, non-random assignment, pseudo-replication and handling of outliers. The remainder of the course will focus on computational approaches to ensure that all data, code, and analyses can be captured in a reproducible workflow, to be confirmed and replicated by you in the future, by other members of your team, and by reviewers and other researchers. We will cover how to satisfy FAIR principles, version control, how to create a git repository, utilize Github and how to create a reproducible dataset. Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of R.

        "description": "Policymakers rely on quantitative systems models to inform decision-making about environmental policy design, infrastructure development, and resource allocation. However, many rapid, transformational changes in the climate and socioeconomic systems are difficult to predict and quantify in models. Therefore, reliance on traditional model-based decision analysis can leave policymakers vulnerable to unforeseen risks. In this class, students will learn quantitative methods for addressing deep uncertainties using systems modeling, enabling them to identify potential vulnerabilities and design decision policies that are robust and resilient to a wide range of uncertain futures. Drawing on tools in simulation, optimization, and machine learning, specific methods include: exploratory modeling, scenario discovery, robust decision making, and adaptation pathways. We will demonstrate these approaches in a range of sustainability domains such as water resources, agriculture, and energy systems. Students will complete Python-based modeling assignments, read contemporary journal articles, and develop a research proposal.  Prerequisites: Prior coursework in applied optimization (e.g. CEE 266G or MS&amp;E 211); and prior coursework in decision or policy analysis (e.g. CEE 275D or MS&amp;E 250A or MS&amp;E 252); and proficiency in Python programming at the level of CME 193",

Through several 1-2 step syntheses, this course trains students on basic organic laboratory techniques on purification of products, including extraction, distillation, recrystallization, thin layer chromatography, and column chromatography, as well as characterization of product structures using IR, GC-MS, and NMR spectroscopy. This course reviews MS, IR, and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy knowledge from Chem 33 and 121 with an emphasis on the practical interpretation of spectra, so that students can become independent in using these techniques to identify the purity and structures of organic compounds.nPrerequisite: Chem 121.

        "description": "Required of and open only to Earth Systems co-terminal MS and MA students. This course has several elements, including, skill building through experiential learning and reflection and professional development. Students will either work in teams with a community partner in the Bay area on a predetermined project, or select a self- designed project with a partner anywhere in the world. The idea is to complete a well-defined, manageable, but important project to a high standard under significant time constraints. Our community partners have requested help with achieving their missions and seminar students will utilize their backgrounds in social/environmental problem solving to deliver a final product. Our partners have requested help with such efforts as grant and report writing, data analysis, curriculum development, symposium organizing, presentation research and preparation and communications to raise awareness about an environmental challenge. If you choose to design your own project, the instructor will help you to create this opportunity. Students will give oral presentations on their project progress throughout the quarter, culminating in a final presentation at a symposium with our partners. Students will also explore how best to communicate their interdisciplinary skills and goals through their resumes, CV's or cover letters, portfolios or linkedIn profiles in preparation for the next phase of their career. Guest speakers and in class workshops will complement these activities.Cardinal Course certified by the Haas Center.",

        "description": "This course presents the power system engineering and economic concepts necessary to understand the costs and benefits of transitioning to a low carbon electricity supply industry. The technical characteristics of generation units and transmission and distribution networks as well as the mechanisms used to operate the electricity supply industries will be studied. The fundamental economics of wholesale markets and how intermittent renewables impact the price and quantity of physical and financial products traded in these markets (e.g., energy, capacity, ancillary services, and financial contracts) will be analyzed. Long-term resource adequacy mechanisms will be introduced and their properties analyzed. The role of both short-duration and seasonal energy storage will be analyzed. Mechanisms for determining the engineering and economic need for transmission network expansions in a wholesale market will be discussed. The impact of distributed versus grid-scale generation on the performance of electricity supply industries will be studied.  A detailed treatment of electricity retailing will focus on the importance of active demand-side participation in a low carbon energy sector. This course uses knowledge of probability at the level of Stats 116, optimization at the level of MS&amp;E 111, statistical analysis at the level of Economics 102B, microeconomics at the level of Economics 51 and computer programming in R.",

The technical characteristics of generation units and transmission and distribution networks as well as the mechanisms used to operate the electricity supply industries will be studied. The fundamental economics of wholesale markets and how intermittent renewables impact the price and quantity of physical and financial products traded in these markets (e.g., energy, capacity, ancillary services, and financial contracts) will be analyzed. Long-term resource adequacy mechanisms will be introduced and their properties analyzed. The role of both short-duration and seasonal energy storage will be analyzed. Mechanisms for determining the engineering and economic need for transmission network expansions in a wholesale market will be discussed. The impact of distributed versus grid-scale generation on the performance of electricity supply industries will be studied.  A detailed treatment of electricity retailing will focus on the importance of active demand-side participation in a low carbon energy sector. This course uses knowledge of probability at the level of Stats 116, optimization at the level of MS&amp;E 111, statistical analysis at the level of Economics 102B, microeconomics at the level of Economics 51 and computer programming in R.",

        "description": "The subject of reinforcement learning addresses the design of agents that improve decisions over time while operating within complex and uncertain environments.  This first course of the sequence restricts attention to the special case of bandit learning, which focuses on environments in which all consequences of an action are realized immediately.  This course covers desired agent behaviors and principled scalable approaches to realizing such behavior.  Topics include learning from trial and error, exploration, contextualization, generalization, and representation learning.  Motivating examples will be drawn from recommendation systems, crowdsourcing, education, and generative artificial intelligence.  Homework assignments primarily involve programming exercises carried out in Colab, using the python programming language and standard libraries for numerical computation and machine learning.

        "description": "VISITING: Open to visitors. TYPE OF CLERKSHIP: Elective. DESCRIPTION: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has become increasingly utilized in multiple medical specialties, with emergency medicine at the forefront.  This rotation is designed to introduce point-of-care ultrasound to the clinical medical student and provide more in-depth and hands-on familiarity with bedside US for a variety of modalities. These skills will better equip students to use these techniques at the bedside of any patient in the emergency room or on the floors with greater facility and confidence. It will enhance patient diagnosis and management, procedural guidance, and patient satisfaction. It may even save a life! Primary emphasis will be on developing competent technical skills to enhance image acquisition and interpretation. The applications as defined by the American College of Emergency Physicians will be the main focus. A goal for a minimum number of ultrasound scans will be 25 per application including, eFAST, thoracic, renal, RUQ, aorta, limited ECHO and IVC, first trimester pelvic, DVT, orbital, MSK. Other advanced ultrasound applications will potentially be introduced (airway, bladder, nerve blocks). Students will obtain US images in the Stanford Emergency Department and will have imaging formally reviewed by a US fellowship trained emergency medicine faculty member. Images will be obtained during scan shifts during which students will scan appropriate patients and review images with the faculty member onsite and independently. Students will attend Bedside US didactics offered by an US EM faculty member every Thursday morning, followed by quality assessment (QA) review of Ultrasound scans performed in the ED. Students will have access and be expected to participate in online and computer-based learning that will be provided for them as well. This clerkship requires prior approval by Clerkship Director. Contact clerkship director Dr. Nick Ashenburg (ashenburg@stanford.edu) and clerkship coordinator Ezra Tesfay (etesfay@stanford.edu). For visiting international students, please submit your application directly through the International Visiting Student (IVS) Program via https://med.stanford.edu/clerkships/international.html. Please contact visiting-MD-students@stanford.edu if you have any additional questions regarding the IVS Program. PREREQUISITES: Medicine and Surgery rotations, MS 4/5 given preference over MS3.  PERIODS AVAILABLE: 4-11, full time for 4 weeks, 2 students per period (subject to change by period).  CLERKSHIP DIRECTOR:  Dr. Nick Ashenburg, ashenburg@stanford.edu. CLERKSHIP COORDINATOR: Ezra Tesfay, etesfay@stanford.edu. REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS: Where: TBA; Time: 9:00 am. CALL CODE: 0. OTHER FACULTY: K. Anderson, Y. Duanmu, V. Lobo, M. Askar, C. Hill.

        "title": "Policy Practicum:  Alabama Innovation",
        "description": "Client: Innovate Alabama, https://innovatealabama.org/.  The newly established Alabama Innovation Commission, known as Innovate Alabama, has sought policy recommendations from a group of faculty at Stanford University, including representatives from Stanford Law School and the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The goal of the Alabama Innovation Commission is to identify and present to policymakers policies that will promote innovation, entrepreneurship, economic development, and high-skilled jobs in the state. In this policy lab, students will work on papers whose results will be incorporated with attribution into the recommendations provided to the Commission and the Governor. Where possible, projects will be conducted in partnership with students at the major research universities in Alabama. Available topics for projects include building on the state's existing competencies in medical research and space and defense technology; assessing financial incentives for attracting businesses; deploying broadband-based education; fostering the role of universities in economic development; and drawing high-skilled workers through opportunities for outdoor recreation.  Students admitted to the lab will work on one of the following projects (to be determined according to the priorities of the client):  1.) Business Incentives and Prosperity. High profile competitions for the headquarters of large corporations often lead states to offer large incentive packages. States that land the deal are often perceived as the winners. Some recruitment initiatives indeed bring substantial local economic benefits, yet recent research has called into question many commonly-held beliefs about state incentives. Such incentives often may have costs that exceed benefits, and there is some question even as to whether they increase local economic activity at the margin in most cases. This project will evaluate Alabama's existing incentives for attracting businesses and make recommendations based on the successes and failures of recent incentive programs around the country. The project will weigh the potential for traditional recruitment tactics such as tax incentives and subsidized industrial sites against alternatives such as infrastructure development, skills development programs, and customized business services. (S. Haber and J. Rauh).  2.) Deploying Broadband-Based Education. The future of Alabama rests on the talent and knowledge of its citizens so the success of K-12 public education must be a potent driver of human capital development.  The work of the Stanford-AL team will look at the current and potential for deploying broadband-based education throughout the state to augment the current capacities of K-12 educators to deliver high quality instruction, especially in the priority areas of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) which ties in closely to economic development plans for the state. (M. Raymond).  3.) Fostering the Role of Universities. It is widely recognized that universities are key to the development of innovative economic activity at the state and local level. The most productive local innovation economies in the US have emerged in locations such as Silicon Valley, North Carolina's Research Triangle, and the Boston area, powered by research that has emerged from local universities. Success stories of the impact of universities on the innovative ecosystem also abound in smaller markets in recent decades. This project will aim to make specific, concrete recommendations for state government policy to build on the strength of Alabama's universities to grow Alabama's technology and innovation economy. (R. Banks and J. Rauh).  4.) The Outdoor Recreation Lab. Persuading someone to move thousands of miles to a new home, a new community, and a new state is not an event; it is a process. It often starts with a short visit that plants a seed in a person's mind. Those crucial, initial, short visits often occur because of tourism; and when it comes to people who have invested in human capital that is specific to high technology industries, that tourism tends to be focused on outdoor recreation. Outdoor recreation tourism is not, however, simply a way to draw high-skilled workers into a state; it is also a way to share the economic rents generated by high tech industries with rural areas. It is the working hypothesis of the Outdoor Recreation Lab that Alabama's Cumberland Plateau has necessary environmental characteristics to be a draw for high tech workers and entrepreneurs/and thus be an important part of building and sustaining a more innovative Alabama economy--but that potential has not been fully developed. The purpose of the Outdoor Recreation Lab is to assess the hypothesis that the Cumberland Plateau is an underdeveloped resource for the State of Alabama. Specifically, the lab will assess its natural endowments as compared to its physical and business infrastructure. An important component of this assessment is the extent of public lands, the interpretation of &quot;public trust&quot; in Alabama law regarding access to navigable rivers and streams, and the number and identity of agencies that would have to be coordinated to provide access to those lands and waterways.  It will also learn about the attempts--both successful and not--by other states to leverage natural endowments to generate in-migration by tech workers and entrepreneurs. (S. Haber).  Additional sub-projects if students are interested may include deep dives into how Alabama can build on existing competencies in Medical Research and in Space/Defense technology to foster the further development of its economy and technology center.  The lab seeks students from the law and business schools, the graduate MS&amp;E program, and other graduate students with a background in entrepreneurship and/or local governance. Students who have ties to Alabama are especially invited to apply.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Performance, Class Participation, Written Assignments.  Cross-listed with the Law School.

Formerly incarcerated individuals face a range of personal and institutional challenges in their reentry into broader society. Considerable research and many programs have focused on systems reform and support and social programs to increase the likelihood of successful reentry. But technological tools also have the potential to help lower friction and increase the success of reentry. This policy lab will engage with challenging legal, social, government systems, and technological questions, with opportunities to design and/or implement new tools to aid in the reentry process. We will work with a variety of stakeholders including government organizations and programs, non-profit entities, and legal innovators to prototype and evaluate new technological solutions to facilitate the reentry process and reduce recidivism.  This practicum will build a collaborative team of diverse backgrounds and skill sets to learn from each other and enhance the overall capacity of the research and tool development. We encourage students who are interested in criminal justice, technology for social impact, access to justice, and entrepreneurship and innovation for social good to join us, including upper-division and graduate students from Law, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, MS&amp;E, Public Policy, and the social sciences.

        "title": "Policy Practicum:  Examining Mandatory Arbitration and NDAs for Gender Discrimination Claims",
        "description": "Client: Lift Our Voices, https://www.liftourvoices.org/.  In recent years, a large fraction of U.S. employers--including many leading law firms -- have required their employees to sign contracts containing mandatory arbitration clauses and &quot;non-disclosure agreements&quot; (NDAs). Available research suggests that more than 60 million American workers are bound by these arbitration clauses, which require employees who have any type of legal claim arising out of their work or workplace to waive their right to trial and resolve their claims, on an individual basis, in private arbitration. Traditionally, arbitration takes place behind closed doors, and the details of the employee's claim (and employer's response), any evidence presented to the arbitrators, the proceedings themselves and the ultimate outcome are confidential. Moreover, employees who are offered monetary settlements to resolve their arbitration claims -- or lawsuits, for those who were not compelled to arbitrate under a contractual provision -- are typically required to sign NDAs as a condition of receiving compensation. As a result of arbitration and NDAs, information about wrong-doing in the workplace -- even egregious wrong-doing -- never becomes public, arguably diminishing the ability of the legal system to deter harmful behavior. Moreover, with claims resolved individually, in private, and settlements protected by NDAs, it is impossible to detect a pattern of wrongful behavior and to hold wrongdoers to account in the public square. These consequences seem particularly problematic in claims arising from gender discrimination, particularly sexual harassment. Secrecy also prevents us from discovering whether women of color or low-income women of all colors are particularly disadvantaged by mandatory arbitration and NDAs.  The expanding use of mandatory arbitration and NDAs in employment claims has evoked considerable controversy and legislation has been introduced at both the national and state level to prohibit the inclusion of these clauses in employment contracts. However, the legislation has yet to move forward on the national level and whether state statutes will withstand challenge is currently unclear. Moreover, there is little systematic evidence of the consequences of mandatory arbitration and NDAs, leaving both supporters and opponents to rely on anecdotes. There is little hard information on the numbers of employees covered by arbitration contracts or how this varies by industry sector and employee gender, race, ethnicity or socio-economic characteristics.  Importantly we do not know how the existence of these contracts affects men and women's willingness to bring their claims to their employers' attention or how claiming varies by race, ethnicity or employee status. Nor do we know how pursuing claims for gender discrimination, including sexual harassment, affects claimants' future career trajectories.  The Client for this policy lab, Lift Our Voices, was co-founded by women's rights advocates and broadcast journalists Gretchen Carlson and Julie Roginsky. Ms. Carlson's sexual harassment suit against powerful former Fox News chairman and CEO Roger Ailes helped pave the way for the #metoo movement. Roginsky left Fox after settling a lawsuit for sexual harassment and discrimination against Fox News, its former co-president Bill Shine and Ailes. To learn more about Lift Our Voices, go to https://www.liftourvoices.org/  The goal of this practicum is to produce objective empirical evidence -- both quantitative and qualitative -- that can be used in Life Our Voices and others' advocacy activities regarding mandatory arbitration and NDAs, including advocacy -- if the data support this -- that argues in favor of restricting or precluding mandatory arbitration and NDAs in some or all circumstances.  In Spring 2021 students in this practicum met with Gretchen Carlson and Julie Roginsky to identify the questions for which empirical evidence would be most useful for policy reform advocacy. Based on these discussions and their review of relevant commentary, the students decided to break up into two teams, each of which would design a research project. Project 1 will interview plaintiff and defense lawyers to develop a better understanding of the incentives for victims of sexual harassment and sexual assault to sign non-disclosure agreements. Project 2 will interview corporate legal counsel in corporations (and potentially law firms) that have abandoned mandatory pre-dispute arbitration contract clauses to develop a better understanding of why these companies and firms abandoned arbitration and what have been the outcomes for the organizations to date. At the end of the spring quarter, each team prepared a memorandum outlining the issues that their team focused on and reviewing the relevant case law and recent statutory reforms. In addition, each team prepared a data collection protocol including draft questionnaires and lists of potential interviewees. The data collection protocols were informed by informal discussions with SLS faculty who are knowledgeable about these issues as well as a few outside advisers.  The goals of the fall quarter are to implement these research designs, collect and analyze data and prepare white papers to share with the clients. Early in the quarter, students will meet with Mss. Carlson and Roginski to discuss policy developments since the spring and may revise the spring quarter students' research designs in response.  The Canvas page for the fall practicum includes the memoranda and other materials the students produced in the spring quarter. Students interested in registering for the fall practicum should review these materials, keeping in mind that they are free to elaborate on them if they wish and if new policy developments suggest this would is appropriate. If a sufficient number of students register for the practicum one or more related projects may be added to our agenda.

        "description": "Human decision making is increasingly being displaced by predictive algorithms. Judges sentence defendants based on statistical risk scores; regulators take enforcement actions based on predicted violations; advertisers target materials based on demographic attributes; and employers evaluate applicants and employees based on machine-learned models. One concern with the rise of such algorithmic decision making is that it may replicate or exacerbate human bias. This course surveys the legal and ethical principles for assessing the equity of algorithms, describes statistical techniques for designing fair systems, and considers how anti-discrimination law and the design of algorithms may need to evolve to account for machine bias. Concepts will be developed in part through guided in-class coding exercises. Admission is by consent of instructor and is limited to 20 students. CONSENT APPLICATION:  To enroll in the class, please complete the course application by March 15, 2021 available at: https://5harad.com/mse330/. Elements used in grading:  Grading is based on response papers, class participation, and a final project.

In this SoCo course, we explore the relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and deliberative democracy, and examine how AI can be used to support and enhance the democratic process through deliberative democracy. This course will focus on the use of AI in the Stanford Online Deliberation Platform (a collaboration between the Crowdsourced Democracy Team and Deliberative Democracy Lab, both at Stanford), the ethics of AI and democracy, and the potential for AI to support deliberation and participation. The course will also explore the challenges and limitations of using AI in a democratic context and the need for effective regulation and governance of AI.",

        "description": "With the recent developments in generative AI, the value in human creativity is increasingly a focus. Course draws from lessons from creativity in the arts to teach engineering students methods for creativity derived from musicians and artists. For our engineering students to learn creativity as a skill that is distinguishable and differentiated from generative artificial intelligence, this course explores, for instance the anatomy of a Hollywood pop song and the process behind the creation of globally impactful art. Students learn how to transfer these skills into the creation of engaging entrepreneurial solutions, for effective storytelling, and in developing their unique personal and professional stories. Students learn skills to unlock creative power which they will apply in the course as a design vehicle for a wide range of applications in engineering, self-expression, technological exploration, and the development of solutions that are centered around human connection and emotional engagement with the user. Sessions are practical, drawing tools and lessons from interdisciplinary individuals with wide-ranging careers. No artistic or entrepreneurial experience necessary.",

        "description": "Explores the ethical reasoning needed to make banking, insurance and financial services safer, fairer and more positively impactful. Weighs tradeoffs in how money is created, privileging some, under-privileging others, using market mechanisms for transforming and trading financial risk, return, maturity and asset types. Technology is changing banks, financial markets, insurance and money. Like technology for medicine, finance is being rebuilt as machine learned code, algorithmic investment rules and regulatory monitoring. Risk models can be built to detect fraud and ethical lapses, or to open doors for them. Investment valuation models can optimize short term or long term returns, by optimizing or ignoring environmental and social impacts. Transparency or opacity can be the norm. Transforming finance through engineering requires finding, applying and evolving codes of professional conduct to make sure that engineers use their skills within legal and ethical norms. Daily, financial engineers focus on two horizons: on the floor, we stand on the bare minimum standards of conduct, and on the ceiling, we aim for higher ethical goals that generate discoveries celebrated though individual fulfillment and TED Talks. Stanford engineers, computer scientists, data scientists, mathematicians and other professionals are building systems for lending, investment and portfolio management decisions that determine future economic and social growth. This course uses the case method to preview intersecting codes of conduct, legal hurdles and ethical impact opportunities, and creates as a safe academic setting for seeing career-limiting ethical stop signs (red lights) and previewing &iquest;what&iquest;s my life all about&iquest; events, as unexpected threats or surprising ah-ha moments. Guest speakers will highlight real life situations, lawsuits and other events where ethics of financial engineering was a predominant theme, stumbling block or humanitarian opportunity.",

        "description": "Dynamic System: Provides a solid foundation in understanding and modeling the dynamics of change. Differential equations are used as a mathematical language to facilitate discussions on dynamic phenomena. Develop mathematical tools to analyze the dynamic models, and use such tools to think about and manage the dynamics of change. The course covers the notions of equilibrium, stability, growth and limit cycle of dynamic systems and discussed in terms of examples in product market penetration, business competition, ecology and spread of epidemics. The course gives an introduction to Catastrophe Theory, which provides a mathematical model for certain discontinuous phenomena like the crash of the stock market and the extinction of species. The course concludes with optimal control theory and differential games. Optimal economic growth model and optimal dynamic pricing are used to illustrate how the optimal control theory is applied to economic modeling analysis and business application. A platform competition model is used to illustrate how different games can be used to do dynamic competitive analysis. Required a project in dynamic system modeling.

The course will further explore the trade-offs between efficiency and equitable outcomes and how to reach desired outcomes. Applications include matching students to schools, college admissions and the failure the desire to balance equity and merit, assigning vaccines, assigning interns to hospitals, assigning organs to patients, auction designs and pricing, information design, online platforms, allocation of food, transportation, and emissions. The course is intended for undergraduates, masters, but also PhD students who are interested in exposure to market design.

        "description": "The pandemic and geopolitics present a new inflection point that all industries and countries need to manage properly in order to survive the crisis and create new opportunities for growth. The globalization structure that we have taken for granted in the past fifty years is gone and a new globalization structure is slowly emerging. Instead of global supply chains and global markets, we may have strong regional supply chains and regional markets and weak connections between regions. It is not clear what the final structure will be, but one thing for sure is that the dynamic formation of the new globalization structure will be shaped by how companies and countries respond and manage the new inflection point through disruptive innovations. In this new globalization era, we need to re-think innovation factoring the unquantifiable pandemic and geopolitical risk into product development and business expansion decisions. For emerging technology businesses like clean energy, one needs to develop a resilient supply chain structure that would provide a proper balance between cost and risk exposure to unexpected disruption due to pandemic and geopolitics. For an established industry, like semiconductor, there will be new risk exposure in the current supply chain structure. New supply chain structures will emerge as companies respond to the disruptions caused by pandemics and geopolitics. We discuss the possible changes in the supply chain structure and how companies in the related industries should establish proper risk management policies and procedures to increase the chance of successfully managing the inflection point and creating new opportunities for their growth. To support developing a resilient supply chain, we identify new 0-1 innovation opportunities and discuss the important role that government can play in this new changing era that would shape the structure of new globalization and spur new national economic growth. We pick the following specific industries to focus our discussions: semiconductor, clean energy, mobile communication, robotics and AI.",

        "description": "Most organizations are drawn to data science by the tantalizing prospects of competitive advantage and disruptive capabilities.  Yet many organizations are finding that their data science teams are not providing the expected business impact, and some are beginning to question the ROI of these teams altogether.  This course works to bridge the gap between the technical training that data scientists spend years mastering and the role they must play in their companies to successfully drive business impact.  Drawing on inside accounts, case studies, and academic research, this course identifies the key capabilities that data science teams and their business partners must develop to successfully drive business impact.  We explore how impactful data science teams have made a fundamental shift toward business understanding and impact accountability, even while ensuring that their statistics are pristine.  This course lays out a practical &quot;how to&quot; guide for designing and enabling impact-driven data science teams, including templates and exercises for applying these practical insights in any organizations.",

The presentations will be devoted to: illuminating how people in the area being explored that day think about and approach problems, and illustrating what can and cannot be done when addressing problems by deploying the knowledge, perspectives, and skills acquired by those who specialize in the area in question. Area faculty will attend and participate. During the last two weeks of the quarter groups of first year students will make presentations on how they would approach a problem drawing on two or more of the perspectives to which they have been exposed earlier in the class. Attendance is mandatory and performance will be assessed on the basis of the quality of the students&iquest; presentations and class participation. Restricted to first year MS&amp;E PhD students.",

        "description": "The advent of cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and more generally, online financial instruments that are not controlled by large governments or banks, has resulted in many new and innovative mechanisms for decentralized finance. This class studies these new mechanisms from the viewpoint of algorithms, optimization, and market design. While blockchains have been a primary motivation behind many of these new developments, the resulting algorithmic and market design issues are more general, and we abstract away the specifics of blockchains and the underlying cryptographic primitives. Topics include distributed and multi-asset exchanges, liquidity pools, automated market makers, credit networks, and rollups (off-chain transactions). We draw connections between these new market mechanisms and more well-studied directions such as prediction markets and Arrow-Debreu equilibria. Includes a research project and a discussion of open directions. Prerequisites: algorithms at the level of CS 161 and optimization at the level of MS&amp;E 111.",

Designed to provide an introduction to some of the most commonly used quantitative techniques for causal inference in social data including: survey design and inference, regression and propensity score matching, instrumental variables, differences-in-differences, regression discontinuity designs, standard errors, and the analysis of big data. Applications: organizations, entrepreneurship, public policy, innovation, economics, online education, visual representations, communication, critique and design of figures, graphs. Does not explicitly cover social network structure or machine learning as these topics are well-covered elsewhere. Students work in groups and individually to design and carry out a small research project based on the use of analytics, large data sets, or other digital innovations related to business or other organizations. Students become acquainted with a variety of approaches to research design, and are helped to develop their own research projects. Course prioritizes a thorough substantively grounded understanding of assumptions over mathematical proofs and derivations. Aimed at PhD students, but open by permission to Master's students and to students in other Stanford programs with relevant coursework or experience in analytics and statistics.",

In this course, using material adapted from what is taught second-year medical students at the Stanford School of Medicine, we will explore different neurologic ailments to provide a window into the mysteries of brain function (and dysfunction). All that is needed is a solid background in high school biology, and the burning desire to dive deep into the complex and fascinating world of clinical neuroscience. Students will be provided the background neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and neuropathology that is necessary to understand the underpinnings, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of some of the most common diseases that affect the central nervous system. Lectures are taught by clinical faculty from the Department of Neurology &amp; Neurological Sciences and will use real cases, neuroimaging, and videos in an interactive and stimulating setting. Students will learn about the cutting-edge technologies used in 2020 in Neurology and Neurosurgery to manage patients with these illnesses. Get ready for an exciting and dynamic sneak peek into medical school and the mysteries of the human brain!",

        "description": "This course is an exploration of the drift method: a family of simple, yet surprisingly powerful, meta-algorithms that in each step the greedily and incrementally minimizes a certain potential function. Manifested in different forms, MaxWeight, c-mu rule, EXP3, policy gradient, to name a few, the drift method powers some of the most popular algorithmic paradigms in queueing networks, optimization and machine learning. Using the drift method as a unifying theme, we will explore major developments in these areas to understand what features can explain the method's effectiveness, how we can rigorously evaluate its performance, and what are some of the emerging research topics.We will develop rigorous probabilistic and optimization methodologies for answering these questions, such as Lyapunov stability theory, state-space collapse, and weak convergence. Applications to be covered include dynamic control and scheduling in queueing networks, delay and stability analysis of stochastic networks, stochastic approximation, and online/supervised/reinforcement learning. The course will be primarily taught in a lecture format, along with some guest lectures and student project presentations.Objective: For students to acquire fundamental methodologies that can be applied to pursuing research topics in theoretical or applied areas.Target Audience: The course is intended for PhD students in Business, Engineering and Economics. The students should have a good background in probability and stochastic processes (e.g., Stat 310A / MS&amp;E 321). Most topics will be self-contained.",

DESCRIPTION:  In this rotation, medical students observe and participate in our outpatient addiction medication management, office-based opioid replacement therapy, group psychotherapy, multi-disciplinary assessment/consultation clinics, and available residential services located within the VA Palo Alto Health System. A typical day includes an admission, which is a typical psychiatric work-up with an additional emphasis on substance abuse assessment; group therapy meetings throughout the day utilizing various psychotherapeutic modalities; a multidisciplinary staff meeting focused on individualized care and management approaches; and a community meeting, in which milieu events are processed. The overall goal is to become familiar with general psychiatry, intensive psychotherapy, and psychosocial resources, while gaining exposure to substance abuse treatment issues. Residential programs combine elements of both inpatient and outpatient settings and are unique in this regard. The attending psychiatrist teaches history-taking, DSM diagnoses, and psychopharmacology for substance use disorders.

        "title": "Psychosomatic Medicine (Psychiatry Consultation Service) Clerkship",
        "description": "VISITING: Open to visitors. TYPE OF CLERKSHIP: Elective. DESCRIPTION: Psychosomatic Medicine (PM) comprises the area of psychiatry concerned with the psychobiological care of the medically ill, which includes persons of all ages and those cared for in specialized medical settings. PM- psychiatrists, in addition to providing expert formal psychiatric consultation to medical and surgical patients in the general hospital, specialized hospitals and outpatient clinic settings, also train psychiatrists and non-psychiatrists in the recognition of normal and abnormal reactions to illness and appropriate psychological care of patients with such reactions. The PM psychiatrist may function both as a consultant and as part of the primary medical/surgical treatment team. Via conjoint rounds and teaching conferences (primary intervention), formal consultations (secondary intervention), and involvement in inpatient treatment and discharge planning (tertiary intervention), the PM psychiatrist provides a comprehensive approach to the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral needs of the patient. Thus one unique feature of our program is how the members of our team are integral member of so many other medico-surgical teams throughout the medical center. Participation in this rotation should allow students to learn about diagnosis and management of psychiatric disorders common in all medical and surgical specialties, e.g., depression, anxiety, delirium, alcohol abuse, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders, and somatic symptom and related disorders. Students will accompany psychiatric residents, fellows and faculty five days a week in performing consultations on medical-surgical units in SUH and in performing follow-up visits. Team rounds occur every morning.  Formal didactic sessions occur twice weekly. Students will learn interview techniques, how to evaluate patients' psychosocial stressors and resources, how to write a cogent case report, present and discuss cases orally, work comfortably as a team member, perform differential diagnosis for depression, delirium, anxiety states, dementia, discuss indications and contra-indications for psychotropic medications and recognize and cope with emotional reactions to patients. Students will also learn advanced psychopharmacology, brief psychotherapy, management of difficult patients, and psychological and cultural aspects of the doctor-patient relationship.

        "description": "VISITING: Open to visitors. TYPE OF CLERKSHIP: Selective 2. DESCRIPTION: The inpatient psychiatry subinternship at Stanford is designed to provide a training experience similar to that of PGY1 psychiatry residents on an inpatient rotation. Subinternships go above and beyond the Core Psychiatry Clerkship and involve levels of intensity and commitment expected of beginning interns. While still supervised as medical students by the attendings, the subinterns should be preparing themselves mentally and physically for internship training. The subinternship at Stanford offers a diverse patient population across genders, adult ages, social economic status, and ethinicities. Of note, it offers cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy experiences, medical-psychiatry cases, forensic/hearing exposure, and ECT observation. The overarching goal of the psychiatry sub-internship is that, upon successful completion of the rotation, students will be ready to function at the level of a first-week psychiatry intern and be able to discuss his or her performance according to six ACGME competencies. Objectives that set the subinternship apart from the core psychiatry clerkship are (1) demonstrate progression from &quot;interpreter&quot; to &quot;manager&quot; in the &quot;reporter-interpreter-manager-educator&quot; (RIME) scheme; (2) efficiently manage a caseload of 3 to 6 patients at a time; (3) assist the attending in teaching patients/families, core clerkship medical students, and/or staff; and (4) evaluate his or her efforts towards self-reflective practice and self-directed learning. Please note: Visiting students must obtain approval from Ms. Quynh Dang prior to applying for this clerkship. Please email requests to qdang@stanford.edu. PREREQUISITES: Psychiatry 300A. PERIODS AVAILABLE: 1-12, full time for 4 weeks, 1 student per period. CLERKSHIP DIRECTOR: Justin Birnbaum, M.D., 650-736-0106.

        "description": "In today's competitive marketplace, companies -- from Fortune 500 firms to early stage start-ups -- rely on intellectual property (IP) to keep them one step ahead of the game. Yet, critical IP decisions are usually made by lawyers with very little input from management. The purpose of this class is to provide business leaders with the tools, models and institutional knowledge to actively participate in managing and growing their company's IP assets as strategic business assets (with a focus on patents). This class will explore the value of corporate IP assets by thinking strategically on how to effectively leverage the knowledge, trade secrets, patents, technologies, trademarks, structures and processes that are critical across industries. We will focus on the elements of a successful IP strategy, and how that strategy is shaped by economic, technology, legal, regulatory, and market factors. Through a combination of case studies (including a group strategy project), analysis of current events, class discussion and guest speakers, we will cover a variety of issues shaping a successful IP strategy in today's global business environment. Some of the topics covered include: * Building and managing an IP portfolio that is aligned with business objectives;* Understanding the forces shaping the IP marketplace in the US and in foreign markets;* The innovation cycle and technology transfer mechanisms;* Using big data analytics in making IP decisions;* IP portfolio monetization strategies (e.g., licensing, sale, enforcement);* IP considerations in Mergers &amp; Acquisitions;* IP valuation and current trends in patent transactions;* Managing corporate IP litigation risk (patent trolls, incumbent litigation);* IP strategies for start-ups &amp; entrepreneurs.Ms. Efrat Kasznik is an IP valuation and strategy expert with more than twenty years of experience advising companies of all sizes, from startups to Fortune 100s, on extracting value from their IP. She is the founder and President of Foresight Valuation Group, an IP consulting and startup advisory firm providing valuation and strategy services for a range of purposes, including M&amp;A, financial reporting, technology commercialization decisions, tax compliance, transfer pricing, and litigation damages. Ms. Kasznik has been a co-founder, CFO and advisor to several startups and incubators in the US and Europe. She is listed on the IAM 300 list of World Leading IP Strategists, and is on the Board of the Licensing Executives Society, USA-Canada.",
