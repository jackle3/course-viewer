        "description": "This three-quarter sequence asks big questions of major texts in the European and American tradition. What is a good life? How should society be organized? Who belongs? How should honor, love, sin, and similar abstractions govern our actions? What duty do we owe to the past and future? This third and final quarter focuses on the modern period, from the rise of revolutionary ideas to the experiences of totalitarianism and decolonization in the twentieth century. Authors include Locke, Mary Shelley, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Weber, Primo Levi, and Frantz Fanon. N.B. This is the third of three courses in the European track. These courses offer an unparalleled opportunity to study European history and culture, past and present. Take all three to experience a year-long intellectual community dedicated to exploring how ideas have shaped our world and future. Students who take HUMCORE 11 and HUMCORE 12Q will have preferential admission to HUMCORE 13Q (a WR2 seminar). **NOTE** This class meets Monday and Wednesday in room 20-22K and Fridays in room 260-113 to attend a lecture along with the other two HUMCORE courses this quarter.",

This is a course about murders, break-ins, betrayals, sexual infidelity and violence, and crimes against humanity, and the ways those crimes, sometimes moral, sometimes legal, and sometimes not really even exactly criminal, teach us about German and German literature in recent centuries. Course material will include modern and classical crime fiction (Friedrich Glauser, Friedrich D&uuml;rrenmatt, Jakob Arjouni, Thomas Glavinic), crime in novelistic, theatrical and poetic genres (Anna Seghers, Bertolt Brecht, Heinrich von Kleist, Friedrich Schiller), and German-language television and film (Fritz Lang's &quot;M,&quot;Carol Reed's &quot;The Third Man,&quot; &quot;Tatort&quot;). nThis course is for students with good knowledge of German.

We will look at a wide variety of last words, including last words codified as genres&iquest;quotations, suicide notes, epitaphs, dying declarations, Japanese death poems, confessions, and the like as literary devices (last sentences, envois, punch lines, epilogues), and as forms of social or cultural practice (the making of heroes, idols, and martyrs in religious, political, and popular culture). We will look at fictional last words, real last words, last words spoken by heroes, gods, and ordinary people. And we will end the course, each of us, by writing out our own last words imagining what we each would write, if we had to sum up what mattered most to us, and if we wanted some small selection of signs to stand in, as it has for many of the authors we will read, for our life and the legacy of it.",

You will learn how to read, understand, and if you don't already like poetry. We will read poems from different centuries, different kinds of writers, and different media (paper, computer screens, and even DNA); they will be about loss and love and war and loyalty and bacteria. Some of them will be about you. You will develop interpretive skills that come with this range of poetic forms and structures and will learn how to think about what it means for something to be poetic, whether it is a poem, a Leonard Cohen song, a last minute field goal, or a toilet. Can the poems in this class really change your life? (What would that even mean? We'll discuss.) Maybe; maybe not. But they're certainly going to try.",

The European Union, a project of an ever closer union of European states with currently 28 members started with the promise to provide peace, stability and prosperity. This narrative attracted new members in five enlargement rounds since the 1970s while today Eurosceptic parties, separatist movements as well as internal and external critics of the EU question the European integration project as such. nnThe course starts with the narrative of the success story of European integration and its achievements. This is followed by an analysis of current crises and future problems. In a third step we will discuss consequences and strategies to deal with challenges for Europe as a whole, as well as the EU and its members in particular. The course will follow ongoing debates within and outside of the EU. It includes global reflections on the state European situation and it makes comparisons with responses to similar challenges in other parts of the world.",

        "description": "Germany defines its foreign policy being based on two pillars: being a part of an integrated Europe and belonging to the Western World. For decades, America and Europe have remained closely connected politically, economically, and culturally. This close working relationship, however, now risks coming to an end, or getting substantially weakened. When asked to identify his &quot;biggest foe globally right now,&quot; President Trump put the European Union on the list, along with China and Russia. Not only deeds but already words have far reaching consequences for Germany in a number of respects. The course addresses the question whether &quot;The Western World&quot; is coming to an end and discusses root causes and possible implications. As the course unfolds, we will cover a number of timely topics, including the future of NATO and why multilateralism matters, how an open society can survive the rising tide of populism, how migration is changing demographics and politics on both sides of the Atlantic, and the prospects for finding political solutions to climate change. We will even address German and European approaches to dealing with digitization and the protection of private data. The course will be discussion based, and include a number of illuminating studies; our goal is to increase students' understanding of the major challenges facing the decades-old American-European alliance and how Germany is dealing with them. Students will need no prior knowledge of Germany and the European Union. Knowledge of the American perspective is welcome but not required.",

Directors' approaches to depicting history are diverse, surprising, and often deeply personal. This class provides you with the opportunity to learn about the past and present in Germany, while reflecting on the relationship between film and history.

At the same time, Rilke's poetry is a unique form of human thought. Many of his poems are poetic meditations on the meaning of human life in a world of great uncertainties. Other poems express poetic wisdom regarding the human condition of finitude, spiritual orientation, and our ability to persevere in the face of pain and loss. This course will serve as an introduction to Rilke's poetry and its place in the modernist canon while discussing its capacity to offer insight, comfort, and hope.

While not discounting those images, this course will position opera at the center of Germany's historical and cultural development over the past three centuries - from early discussions about the country's place between the more culturally hegemonic Italy and France, to its struggle for unification in the 19th century, to the Third Reich's co-opting of all 'German' forms of expression to serve its ends. We will discuss German opera's link to movements like Romanticism and Expressionism, and to philosophers like Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. Along the way, we will learn how to listen to and talk about this very strange genre, and gain fluency in a range of musical styles and periods. No musical expertise required; taught in German.

As a result of the ongoing war in Ukraine, Europe is currently witnessing the largest displacement of humans in a century--and this not far on the heels of 2015, which the UNHCR had previously termed Europe's year of the so-called &quot;refugee crisis.&quot; Yet Germany has a long, painful, and varied history of migration in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, a history this course explores through three themes: forced migration, labor migration, and political migration. How does literature chronicle experiences of migration, displacement, and resettlement? How does it work to archive, critique, and reimagine German national identity in an age of profound sociopolitical transformation? In addition to shorter texts, we will read a complete novel and also consider the role that recent theater and performance art play in thematizing migration.

        "description": "Since the unification of modern Germany in 1871, the history of German environmental movements has been beset with political, cultural, and racial tension. Some of the earliest environmental activists, such as the composer and conservationist Ernst Rudorff, explicitly conceived of conservation as Heimatschutz; or, protection of the homeland. While Rudorff opposed jews and women from participating in the founding of his Heimatschutz organization, the creator of the modern Umwelt concept, the theoretical biologist Jakob von Uexkill, became an early supporter of the Nazi regime. How do we interrogate this disturbing alliance between racial purity, environmental protection, and nation? What does the history of concepts such as Uexkill's Umwelt or Alexander von Humboldt's natural monument, or Naturdenkmal, have to teach policymakers and intellectuals today in the face of environmental crisis? How does does the relationship between race and environment inform current issues about conservation and energy policy in the present? Taught in English with some readings in German.",

        "description": "In this seminar, we will interrogate major currents in media-theoretical work from the German-speaking world from the 1980s to today. Starting from the surprisingly controversial term 'German media theory' itself, which has been described as 'neither a theory nor really centered on media, [while] its Germanness is a contested issue' - we will consider the characteristics that nevertheless make this a recognizable, if internally heterogeneous, category for thinking about media, mediation, and culture. We will pay special attention to the foundational work of Friedrich Kittler, which ranges across literature, film, philosophy, and computers, before turning to the current differentiation into a technology-focused 'media archaeology' (Wolfgang Ernst) and the differently inflected formation of 'cultural techniques' (Bernhard Siegert), as well as recent articulations of 'media philosophy' and other developments in contemporary theory. We will also examine the often absent and/or fraught role of gender, race, and class in this field, as well as attempts to address these issues by such theorists as Ute Holl, Cornelia Vissman, Astrid Deuber-Mankowsky, Annette Bitsch, and Sybille Kr&auml;mer. Readings will be in English translation. Knowledge of German is therefore not required, but readers of German will find plenty of research opportunities among the many as yet untranslated texts that make up the field of German media theory.",

        "description": "Berlin, 1929. A police inspector and his unlikely partner, a typist and aspiring homicide detective, turn up the case of a lifetime: a far-reaching political conspiracy in the capital of a democracy on the edge. Part noir detective thriller, part historical drama, the blockbuster German television series Babylon Berlin (2017) will serve as our springboard to understand the culture, politics, and society of the Weimar Republic (1918,1933), a fifteen-year experiment in democracy that preceded the rise of the Third Reich. From corruption and criminality to sociopolitical upheaval and a remarkable arts scene: Berlin of the Roaring Twenties, a study in contrasts and conflicts, had it all. Does the Netflix hit harbor, almost eerie parallels to the present, as one German newspaper recently suggested?  Weekly viewings of the complete seasons one and two will be accompanied by close study of the era's literature, cinema, and visual arts. Readings will include texts by Alfred D&ouml;blin, Hans Fallada, Erich K&auml;stner, Mascha Kal&eacute;ko, Irmgard Keun, Siegfried Kracauer, Gabriele Tergit, and Kurt Tucholsky. Throughout the term we will also pay careful attention to the media-theoretical implications of the series: What is 'quality TV?' How does seriality influence storytelling and viewing? In what ways does Babylon Berlin reflect on film as a medium? What role do montage and collage play? Assessment will be based on active class participation; a series of short viewing and reading reflections; a midterm scene analysis assignment; and a final research project that will delve into specific historical intertexts (figures, sites, objects) taken up in Babylon Berlin.",

        "description": "Few thinkers can lay claim to the level of sustained impact Karl Marx has achieved. From eco-socialist movements to contemporary investigations of digital capitalism, Marx's grip on the political and cultural imagination has only been further solidified in recent years. While seeking to come to terms with such relevance, this course turns first and foremost to the writings of Marx himself in order to gain insight into how he responded to the pressing issues of his own day. How does Marx deal with topics related to identity and nation in &quot;On the Jewish Question,&quot; for example? How does Marx theorize new forms of value creation enabled by automation in the &quot;Fragment on Machines&quot;? In order to properly appreciate Marx's contemporary relevance, this course seeks to suggest, we must first understand his writings as a product of their own time and place. Readings will be available in both German and English.",

        "description": "&quot;Only a fool reads poetry for facts&quot;: To read a poem with the same fact-seeking attention required by using a dictionary, reading a newspaper article, or following a recipe is, perhaps, foolish. But if it is, it is so only because it means the reader has not understood what a poem is supposed to do. Consider Wittgenstein's famous warning: &quot;Do not forget that a poem, even though it is composed in the language of information, is not used in the language-game of giving information.&quot; A poem, even though it is made of the same (kinds of) words as information, ought not to be treated as information (the sentence seems to say). Distinct in their respective functions, poetry and information form two ends of an opposition: one for the creative possibilities for human expression, the other for the practical and mechanical tasks of everyday life.nBut what really &quot;is&quot; information? Has poetry not, since the beginning of time, also functioned as vehicle for storing, quantifying, and communicating things&iquest;from historical events, the law, to agricultural manuals, just as &quot;informational&quot; texts do?  How has the emergence of technological media in our so-called Information Age altered, reinforced, or revolutionized the place of poetry in the realm of human communication?nThese questions will motivate this course, which is also a general introduction to poetry and poetics. We will closely read German texts from the Musipilli to digital-born poetry, and secondary material from thinkers and theorists such as Schlegel, Schleiermacher, Benjamin, Wittgenstein, Flusser, and Bense, to learn how various methods of reading and literary criticism - from formalism and structuralism to Digital Humanities approaches - have developed alongside something like &quot;information&quot; as literary quality and social form.nAssistant Professor Lea Pao will teach this course.",

        "description": "Since Marshall McLuhan formulated his theory of &quot;media&quot; as &quot;extensions of ourselves,&quot; we've come to understand the history of human communication in terms of its physical carriers, tools, and technologies. From cuneiform, hieroglyphs, and logographic writing systems, to the alphabet, to algorithms; from clay tablets, to papyrus, to LED screens; from scrolls, to books, to the gramophone, to DNA - the medium and the message shape how we store and communicate information. Poetry's place in this history of media has been both elusive and strangely consistent. In media theory, the poem, which Hans Magnus Enzensberger once called an &quot;archaic medium&quot; and Niklas Luhman a &quot;paradoxical form of communication,&quot; often serves as an example of the non-ordinary, of opacity, untranslatability, self-mediation, or hypermediacy. We will read (often lesser known) texts by media theorists (McLuhan, Kittler, Flusser, Benjamin, Luhmann, Siegfried J. Schmidt, Hayles) and a selection of pre-media theory texts on the mediality and mediacy of poetry (Lessing, Hegel, Herder Schleiermacher, Hamburger), as well as one poem each week as we explore the relation between medium and message, content and form.

While exploring each place in a particular historical moment, we will also consider the relations between culture, power, and social life. How does the cultural life of a country intersect with the political activity of a capital? How do large cities shape our everyday experience, our aesthetic preferences, and our sense of history? Why do some cities become cultural capitals? Primary materials for this course will consist of literary, visual, sociological, and historical documents (in translation); authors we will read include Boccaccio, Dante, Sor Juana, Montesquieu, Baudelaire, Gogol, Irmgard Keun, Freud, and Borges.

        "description": "This course is being offered in collaboration with Stanford in Berlin, Bing Overseas Study Program. International politics is beset by problems. States go to war. The global economy is volatile and unequal. The human community is divided into multiple nation-states. Some states dominate others. People commit acts of evil. Luckily, we are not the first people to have noticed that international politics is not characterized exclusively by peace and harmony. War, capitalism, racism, and totalitarianism have all been subjects about which German thinkers - many based in Berlin - have made profound contributions over the last two centuries. Do their ideas and arguments stand up in the cold light of modern social science? What can we learn from them - and what do we need to discard? This course will introduce students to perennial problems in international politics from two perspectives: those of key German political thinkers, and those of modern social science. It is structured around five core questions: Why do states go to war and what could be the basis for a lasting peace? If war is unavoidable, what is the role of morality in war? How can/should the world be governed in the absence of a world state? How has international politics been transformed by capitalism? What role has been and is played by race and racism in international politics?",

        "description": "This course focuses on one of the most famous inventions of the Middle Ages: the Holy Grail. The grail - a mysterious vessel with supernatural properties - is first mentioned in Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes' &quot;Perceval,&quot; but the story is soon rewritten by authors who alter the meaning of both the grail and the quest. By reading three different versions, we will explore how they respond differently to major topics in medieval culture and relevant to today: romantic love, family ties, education, moral guilt, and spiritual practice. The texts are: Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes' &quot;Perceval,&quot; Wolfram von Eschenbach's &quot;Parzival,&quot; and the anonymous &quot;Queste del Saint Graal.&quot; All readings will be available in English.",

        "description": "This class is being offered in collaboration with Stanford in Berlin, Bing Overseas Studies Program. This course will accompany and deepen the experience of Krupp Interns living and working in German cities and towns in summer 2021. Their participant observations in the workplace and in Germany's rich leisure culture, as well as critical consideration of their own assumptions and experiences in the context of cultural exploration, will be recorded in a reflective Arbeitsjournal (critical journal -- genre and language at the discretion of the student). These reflections will be informed by regular reading of the German press (print or online) around themes on which students choose to focus -- be that the history behind the extensive rights and social services that support labor in Germany; or habits, mores and modes of personal interaction in and outside the workplace; or attitudes toward diversity, gender, class in contemporary German culture; or topics of immediate socio-political concern that lend themselves to comparative reflection with home-country culture (e.g. immigration and asylum, structure of systemic and social responses to COVID 19, environmental awareness, vocational training); or religion, or sport culture, or indeed the specific professional sector of the internship itself. Students will submit their completed journals with an annotated reading list at the end of the summer and will give a short presentation during the mandatory Internship Seminar in late August of 2021. Permission code required. You will receive a permission code from Cornelia Kastelan - ckastelan@stanford.edu. This course is restricted to Krupp Internship students in the Program for Stanford Students in Germany.",

Immigration from Turkey is probably the most prominent not only in terms of its massiveness and demographic consequences, but also for its significant role in changing Germany's overall cultural, social, and economic landscape. In this course, through analyzing selected literary works, films, and plays produced by Turkish-German writers and artists, we will discuss complex ideas like migration, ethnicity, race, religion, gender, and class, resorting not to oversimplifications and binary thinking but instead to relevant literary concepts and formative historical moments which have shaped the Turkish-German experience.

At the same time, Rilke's poetry is a unique form of human thought. Many of his poems are poetic meditations on the meaning of human life in a world of great uncertainties. Other poems express poetic wisdom regarding the human condition of finitude, spiritual orientation, and our ability to persevere in the face of pain and loss.

Designed for third- and fourth-year German majors, the course explores the way the ocean has served as a constant vehicle for poetic and philosophical reflection throughout history, from Homer's Odyssey to Paul Valery's Cemetery by the Sea. Combining theoretical studies of seafaring by Hans Blumenberg and Bernard Siegert with literary writings from Franz Kafka and Friedrich H&ouml;lderlin, this course highlights the way nautical activity becomes a theater of political and poetic concerns when our engagement with the ocean is viewed as a metaphor or a cultural technique. In recent years, the sea has also become a flashpoint for environmental concerns due to rising sea levels, leading to calls to take the material status of the ocean itself seriously. The sea, when viewed through the lens of environmental media, continues to serve as a canvas for the projection of human hopes and fears while opening up further questions about the relationship between nature, cultural practices, and theoretical texts. Readings for this course will be in German and English.",

        "description": "&quot;To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric,&quot; Theodor Adorno wrote after the end of World War II, casting doubt on the poet's ability to capture the horrors of the third Reich. But what about theory or philosophy? Is philosophy better equipped to meet the social and cultural demands of life in postwar Germany? In this course, we will explore the wide range of philosophical movements and topics taken up by German thinkers after 1945, from post-war existentialism and the Frankfurt school to the philosophical Anthropology of Arnold Gehlen and Peter Sloterdijk. How does meaning making relate to the writing of history in Hannah Arendt and Hans Jonas? What role does history play in Gadamer's hermeneutics or Blumenberg's metaphorology? How do Martin Heidegger, Friedrich Kittler, and Niklas Luhmann respond to the development of new technology? And how do these analyses relate to the myriad cultural and political concerns that emerged in a rapidly complexifying society? Taught in German and English.",

        "description": "When World War II ended, most of the states that described themselves as &quot;fascist&quot; ended with it. Nevertheless, fascism haunted postwar democracy as an ever-present threat. The question of what exactly had characterized fascism, and what parts of it persisted within liberal democracies themselves, were continuously and contentiously debated. This question has emerged all the more forcefully in recent years as &quot;illiberal,&quot; or &quot;right-wing populist,&quot; movements and governments have begun to question the basic premises of liberal democracy. What was fascism, and what would it mean for it to return? This course considers writings by philosophers, historians, journalists and writers, and moves from early anti-fascist writings to critiques of online movements and neo-reactionaries.",

Queer Theory emerged in response to feminist thought, and the study of the history of sexuality, building on their insights, but also uncovering their blind spots. Without Queer Theory, few of the discourses around desire, power and gender identity that we take for granted on college campuses today would exist. Yet there is also a real risk that reality has left the theory behind. In this course, we will try to answer the question: What do we need queer theory for? Do we still need it? And if so, of what kind? The course  is designed to introduce students to core texts of queer theory, and to connect them to current debates, be this around trans rights, the representation of homosexuality or the fight against campus sexual assault.",

        "description": "In modern perception, the definition of Germany's various cultural landscapes often follows narratives of regional remoteness and aesthetic coherency. Today's Bundesland (federal state) of Hesse makes a case in point. Ever since the Brothers Grimm collected many of their fairy tales there, its image is defined by ideas of small picturesque towns with half-timbered houses and impressive castles on hilltops. However, a closer look clearly reveals that Hesse's countryside was and is rather heterogeneous and diverse in its architectural and artistic heritage, just like in many other &quot;typical&quot; German regions. In this class, we invite students to study the rich artistic heritage of medieval Hesse with us in order to re-define a scholarly concept of &quot;cultural landscape&quot; as a dynamic interaction of route, place, and object. Rather than being a remote region, Hesse was determined by important trans-European routes enabling the transfer of objects and ideas. Along these passages, a dynamic network of micro-landscapes around certain places like towns, abbeys, castles but also bridges with partly distinct political and religious connotations could both develop and transform over a long period. It is our aim to create a better understanding for a historically grounded diversity of German cultural landscapes.NO CLASS during the first week. Class will begin 10/5.",

Readings include Arendt's &lt;em&gt;The Origin of Totalitarianism&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Human Condition, Between Past and Future&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Men in Dark Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;On Revolution&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;Eichmann in Jerusalem&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Life of the Mind&lt;/em&gt;, as well as considerations of Hannah Arendt's work by Max Frisch, J&uuml;rgen Habermas, Seyla Benhabib, Judith Butler, Giorgio Agamben, and others. Special attention will be given to Arendt's writings on literature with an emphasis on Kafka, Brecht, Auden, Sartre, and Camus. This course will be synchronously conducted, but will also use an innovative, Stanford-developed, online platform called Poetic Thinking. Poetic Thinking allows students to share both their scholarly and creative work with each other. Based on the newest technology and beautifully designed, it greatly enhances their course experience.",

Stanzel, K&auml;te Hamburger, Monika Fludernik, Siegfried J. Schmidt). Alongside these theoretical approaches, we will read two German novels, which we'll use as experimental playground to better test and understand how and why literary theory can help us construct models of reading, world-making, human experience, and storytelling. Towards the end of the course, we'll switch to the open questions and future of narrative theory: what media of long-form storytelling come after the novel? What do they have in common with, say, the novels of J.W. Goethe, Adalbert Stifter, Lou Andreas-Salom&eacute;, or Ingeborg Bachmann? How would we expand narrative theory to include today's most important and engaging sites of storytelling (like video games or serial television)? Taught in German.",

        "description": "Middle High German (MHG), a form of German spoken in the High Middle Ages c. 1050&iquest;1350, constitutes one of the most important medieval languages of Europe. Numerous fundamental classics of European literature were originally composed in MHG, among them the Nibelungenlied, Wolfram von Eschenbach&iquest;s Parzival, and Meister Eckhart&iquest;s German Sermons. Reading skills in this language will thus allow literary scholars and historians to both appreciate well-known texts in their original form and access a range of untranslated literary works and sources. Working with different textual examples, students will learn how to read and translate MHG texts. They will additionally gain an overview of the history of the German language. Focusing on reading comprehension, this course will take a hands-on approach to key methods and concepts of historical linguistics (etymology, dialectology, historical semantics, phonetic history, premodern Germanic morphology and syntax). Additionally, students will learn how to work with printed and digital tools for translating MHG texts (lexical databases, dictionaries, historical grammars). German skills of intermediate level or higher are required. Assignments include weekly translation exercises.",

As space travel developed from a dream to a reality, and as Germany changed borders and political systems among empires, dictatorships, socialist states, and capitalist states, German interest in spaceflight remained, although the meaning found in the stars changed dramatically. This course considers Germans' dreams of and predictions for outer space travel alongside German technological developments in spaceflight. It includes the different German states throughout the century, including Weimar Germany, National Socialism, East Germany, and West Germany. The course looks at science fiction films and novels, newspaper reports, scientific developments, and German space engineering projects, which together demonstrate how and why space travel often found high levels of support in Germany. Students will engage in historical and cultural analysis through course readings, discussions, and assignments.nNOTE: To be eligible for WAYS credit, you must take this course for a minimum of 3 units and a letter grade.",

        "description": "In &quot;Woman's Art: A Manifesto&quot; (1972), the artist, performer and filmmaker Valie Export (1940) proposed the transfer of women's experience into an art context and considered the body &quot;a signal bearer of meaning and communication.&quot; In reconceptualizing and displaying &quot;the&quot; body (her body) as an aesthetic sign, Export's groundbreaking work paves the way towards questioning the concepts of a &quot;female aesthetic&quot; and a &quot;male gaze&quot; (L. Mulvey). Beginning with Export, we will discuss art informed by and coalescing with feminism(s): the recent revival of the 1970s in all-women group shows, the dialectic of feminist revolution, the breakdown of stable identities and their representations, point(s) of absorption of commodified femininities. Particular attention will be paid to German-language theory and its medial transfer into art works. For students of German Studies, readings and discussions in German are possible. Online discussions will be organized with contemporary artists and curators. Emphasis will be on: the relationship between (female?) aesthetics and (gender) politics, between private and public spheres, between housework and artwork; conceptions of identity (crises) and corporeality in visual culture and mass media; categories of the artist&acute;s self in relation to the use of media (video, photography, film, collage, installation art). This course will be taught by Professor Elena Zanichelli, a Berlin-based art historian, critic, and curator.

        "description": "In April of 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, a huge controversy erupted in Germany on the relation between Postcolonial and Holocaust Studies. Previously, in 2012, Judith Butler on the occasion of being awarded the Adorno Prize was assailed for her support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. This time, the philosopher Achille Mbembe, from Cameroon, the former German colony, was accused of antisemitism. His comparison of Israel with the apartheid state in South Africa and his critique of Palestine's occupation as a form of settler colonialism is condemned for relativizing the Holocaust and questioning the Israeli state's right to exist. The allegation of &quot;postcolonial antisemitism&quot; resurfaced in 2022 in the context of the Documenta 15 in Kassel. The curators, ruangrupa, an Indonesian art collective, are accused of antisemitism, of supporting BDS and of the &quot;silent boycott&quot; of Jewish-Israeli artists.These controversies confront us with the challenge of how to think together antisemitism and racism. In this class, we will engage with critical scholarship to address the conundrums of memory politics and to engage with the &quot;unfinished conversations&quot; between Jewish and Postcolonial Studies.",

This selection of poetry will be a mix of canonical poems we will read anew and unknown poems we will discover for the first time. With each poem we will practice different modes of interpretation, close reading methods, and reading techniques; and we will think about the cultural status of writing, reading, and sharing poetry. Second, we will also spend time reading texts written about poetry, its purposes, uses, histories, and developments. The retellings of Greek myths, the Klopstockian rejection of Latin hexameter, the experimentation with forms like the Alexandrine, the madrigal or the pantoum, the poetry of climate change: all make clear how German poetry exists within the context of a global poetics. What this global angle changes about how we read and think about German poetry and poetics will be our guiding question throughout the quarter. Taught in German.",

Designed for third- and fourth-year German majors, the course explores the way the ocean has served as a constant vehicle for poetic and philosophical reflection throughout history, from Homer's Odyssey to Paul Valery's Cemetery by the Sea. Combining theoretical studies of seafaring by Hans Blumenberg and Bernard Siegert with literary writings from Franz Kafka and Friedrich H&ouml;lderlin, this course highlights the way nautical activity becomes a theater of political and poetic concerns when our engagement with the ocean is viewed as a metaphor or a cultural technique. In recent years, the sea has also become a flashpoint for environmental concerns due to rising sea levels, leading to calls to take the material status of the ocean itself seriously. The sea, when viewed through the lens of environmental media, continues to serve as a canvas for the projection of human hopes and fears while opening up further questions about the relationship between nature, cultural practices, and theoretical texts. Readings for this course will be in German and English.",

        "description": "Few thinkers can lay claim to the level of sustained impact Karl Marx has achieved. From eco-socialist movements to contemporary investigations of digital capitalism, Marx's grip on the political and cultural imagination has only been further solidified in recent years. While seeking to come to terms with such relevance, this course turns first and foremost to the writings of Marx himself in order to gain insight into how he responded to the pressing issues of his own day. How does Marx deal with topics related to identity and nation in &quot;On the Jewish Question,&quot; for example? How does Marx theorize new forms of value creation enabled by automation in the &quot;Fragment on Machines&quot;? In order to properly appreciate Marx's contemporary relevance, this course seeks to suggest, we must first understand his writings as a product of their own time and place.

        "description": "In modern perception, the definition of Germany's various cultural landscapes often follows narratives of regional remoteness and aesthetic coherency. Today's Bundesland (federal state) of Hesse makes a case in point. Ever since the Brothers Grimm collected many of their fairy tales there, its image is defined by ideas of small picturesque towns with half-timbered houses and impressive castles on hilltops. However, a closer look clearly reveals that Hesse's countryside was and is rather heterogeneous and diverse in its architectural and artistic heritage, just like in many other &quot;typical&quot; German regions. In this class, we invite students to study the rich artistic heritage of medieval Hesse with us in order to re-define a scholarly concept of &quot;cultural landscape&quot; as a dynamic interaction of route, place, and object. Rather than being a remote region, Hesse was determined by important trans-European routes enabling the transfer of objects and ideas. Along these passages, a dynamic network of micro-landscapes around certain places like towns, abbeys, castles but also bridges with partly distinct political and religious connotations could both develop and transform over a long period. It is our aim to create a better understanding for a historically grounded diversity of German cultural landscapes.NO CLASS during the first week. Class will begin 10/5.",

        "description": "In this seminar, we will interrogate major currents in media-theoretical work from the German-speaking world from the 1980s to today. Starting from the surprisingly controversial term 'German media theory' itself, which has been described as 'neither a theory nor really centered on media, [while] its Germanness is a contested issue' - we will consider the characteristics that nevertheless make this a recognizable, if internally heterogeneous, category for thinking about media, mediation, and culture. We will pay special attention to the foundational work of Friedrich Kittler, which ranges across literature, film, philosophy, and computers, before turning to the current differentiation into a technology-focused 'media archaeology' (Wolfgang Ernst) and the differently inflected formation of 'cultural techniques' (Bernhard Siegert), as well as recent articulations of 'media philosophy' and other developments in contemporary theory. We will also examine the often absent and/or fraught role of gender, race, and class in this field, as well as attempts to address these issues by such theorists as Ute Holl, Cornelia Vissman, Astrid Deuber-Mankowsky, Annette Bitsch, and Sybille Kr&auml;mer. Readings will be in English translation. Knowledge of German is therefore not required, but readers of German will find plenty of research opportunities among the many as yet untranslated texts that make up the field of German media theory.",

        "description": "&quot;Only a fool reads poetry for facts&quot;: To read a poem with the same fact-seeking attention required by using a dictionary, reading a newspaper article, or following a recipe is, perhaps, foolish. But if it is, it is so only because it means the reader has not understood what a poem is supposed to do. Consider Wittgenstein's famous warning: &quot;Do not forget that a poem, even though it is composed in the language of information, is not used in the language-game of giving information.&quot; A poem, even though it is made of the same (kinds of) words as information, ought not to be treated as information (the sentence seems to say). Distinct in their respective functions, poetry and information form two ends of an opposition: one for the creative possibilities for human expression, the other for the practical and mechanical tasks of everyday life.nBut what really &quot;is&quot; information? Has poetry not, since the beginning of time, also functioned as vehicle for storing, quantifying, and communicating things&iquest;from historical events, the law, to agricultural manuals, just as &quot;informational&quot; texts do?  How has the emergence of technological media in our so-called Information Age altered, reinforced, or revolutionized the place of poetry in the realm of human communication?nThese questions will motivate this course, which is also a general introduction to poetry and poetics. We will closely read German texts from the Musipilli to digital-born poetry, and secondary material from thinkers and theorists such as Schlegel, Schleiermacher, Benjamin, Wittgenstein, Flusser, and Bense, to learn how various methods of reading and literary criticism - from formalism and structuralism to Digital Humanities approaches - have developed alongside something like &quot;information&quot; as literary quality and social form.nAssistant Professor Lea Pao will teach this course.",

Stanzel, K&auml;te Hamburger, Monika Fludernik, Siegfried J. Schmidt). Alongside these theoretical approaches, we will read two German novels, which we'll use as experimental playground to better test and understand how and why literary theory can help us construct models of reading, world-making, human experience, and storytelling. Towards the end of the course, we'll switch to the open questions and future of narrative theory: what media of long-form storytelling come after the novel? What do they have in common with, say, the novels of J.W. Goethe, Adalbert Stifter, Lou Andreas-Salom&eacute;, or Ingeborg Bachmann? How would we expand narrative theory to include today's most important and engaging sites of storytelling (like video games or serial television)? Taught in German.",

        "description": "Since Marshall McLuhan formulated his theory of &quot;media&quot; as &quot;extensions of ourselves,&quot; we've come to understand the history of human communication in terms of its physical carriers, tools, and technologies. From cuneiform, hieroglyphs, and logographic writing systems, to the alphabet, to algorithms; from clay tablets, to papyrus, to LED screens; from scrolls, to books, to the gramophone, to DNA - the medium and the message shape how we store and communicate information. Poetry's place in this history of media has been both elusive and strangely consistent. In media theory, the poem, which Hans Magnus Enzensberger once called an &quot;archaic medium&quot; and Niklas Luhman a &quot;paradoxical form of communication,&quot; often serves as an example of the non-ordinary, of opacity, untranslatability, self-mediation, or hypermediacy. We will read (often lesser known) texts by media theorists (McLuhan, Kittler, Flusser, Benjamin, Luhmann, Siegfried J. Schmidt, Hayles) and a selection of pre-media theory texts on the mediality and mediacy of poetry (Lessing, Hegel, Herder Schleiermacher, Hamburger), as well as one poem each week as we explore the relation between medium and message, content and form.
