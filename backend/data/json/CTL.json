Topics include course design, creation of reading and writing assignments, rubrics for equitable assessment, discussion facilitation, and building inclusive courses in which all students can see themselves reflected in humanistic study. Class sessions will be highly interactive and provide students with opportunities to develop course materials and practice micro-teaching. The course is a pilot, designed to serve as an anchor course towards a graduate teaching certificate and promote professional development for humanities graduate students at Stanford. Students must have completed at least one quarter as a Teaching Assistant for a humanities course to be eligible to join the course. Those more advanced in their teaching careers and ready to start designing humanities courses of their own will benefit the most.",
