How do people - sociologists, photographers, poets, urban planners, and ordinary New Yorkers - observe the streets, and how do they depict that experience? What do these observations tell us about ourselves, and about the possibilities and inequities of urban life? We will attempt to answer these questions through reading, watching, and listening to the works of New York walkers past and present, and through a close analysis of our own experiences of moving through the city.",

        "description": "Transmitting important messages to the public, rapidly and in a compelling format, can help people to lead happier, healthier and more informed lives. We saw this during the COVID-19 pandemic, when an urgent need arose to disseminate science-based health messages to the public. Because levels of education and literacy vary, didactic and overly technical media messages often miss the audiences that need them the most. Adolescents and young adults are often among the hardest to reach with effective public health messages. At the same time, these audiences are the highest consumers of short video content via social media, presenting an interesting opportunity for public health educators.This course examines various approaches to increasing the reach and effectiveness of digital communication media for global dissemination. We will examine existing evidence-based frameworks including human-centered design, the use of narratives, entertainment-education and how we can apply the principles of universal design for learning to our efforts to engage a broad, global audience.We will also explore novel use cases for animated video interventions in global settings and innovative research methods for evaluating the effectiveness of digital health content, using large, online randomized controlled experiments. This innovative approach to measuring impact emerged out of necessity during the pandemic but is likely here to stay.Students will be exposed to the theory, science and creative process needed to create and test engaging digital communication media. In small groups, students will apply this knowledge to the creation of their own public-facing media message on a topic of interest, integrating new technical skills with art and communication.",

This course will provide an overview of documentary, experimental, and hybrid films that proffer an unexpected and sometimes disturbing perspective on cities, both here and abroad. We will examine films that privilege artistic expression and expand the conventions of the film form, analyzing how filmmakers distill an issue, situation, or environment through a particular formal style and point-of-view.nnThrough a consideration of iconic historic films, the student will gain a rich understanding of how cities have inspired filmmakers who work outside the traditional fiction genre. In addition to written assignments, students will distill their own experience of the city through photo essays that explore the eclectic geographic, social, and cultural life of New York.  Local &iquest;field trips&iquest; will include attendance at the annual Margaret Mead Film Festival in October and DocNYC in November.

The first part of the quarter will focus on sustainability and the second on resilience. n nThe course will commence with an overview of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) as defined by the United Nations and how New York City is working towards these goals. The components and pillars that lead to a sustainable urban environment will be defined and corresponding metrics will be used to quantify sustainability utilizing simple data analytics tools. Challenges to meeting these goals will be an important part of reading and project assignments. Examples of sustainability efforts within New York City (NYC) include the development of new parks or renewal of industrial areas for recreational use, design of green buildings, rooftop farms and gardens, and the renovation of transportation facilities as focal points. Field trips will include visits to the Highline, the Hudson Yard and the Bank of America building. n nResilience of urban systems will be the focus of the second half of the class. Issues of resilience will be discussed in relation to major disasters including floods, extreme storms and climate change. The 7 global resilience targets will be identified according to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The major components of resilience will be reviewed in class followed by a visit to or by a representative from the 100 Resilient City Initiative supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. The Superstorm Sandy in 2012 will be used as a case study to identify the disaster impact to the urban environment in NYC. We will discuss the emergency response of the City after Sandy and assess the performance of the NYC resilience plan. We will explore how New York City is preparing to respond and recover from future major disasters as part of the 100 Resilient Cities Initiative supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. n nNovel technologies will be discussed in terms of their implications for disaster resilience and sustainability. We will delve into a case study showing how modern and decentralized power systems with rooftop solar panels and microgrids can make NYC more resilient and sustainable.",

        "title": "Just Art?  Equity, Immigration and Art in the Global City",
        "description": "This course focuses on relations between art, immigration and equity. Through several case studies, we will learn to think critically about how aesthetics and politics work together.  In addition to studying particular works of art, we will travel to several foundations and institutions to learn about their strategies for fostering equity and the arts.  How do art, activism and racial justice connect in performances aimed at changing ideas?  How do major arts institutions address questions of equity and difference? We will discuss how art can function as a form of aesthetic knowledge in the service of justice.  In doing so, we will grapple with the role of the creative arts in mitigating social change and study artists who have sought to intervene in the restrictive covenants of racial, gender and other segregationist or national orders.  Our case studies will shift across media, subjects, objects and temporalities.  From artists in New York responding to the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to the radical work of Yayoi Kusama&iquest;s 1960s performances, to a plays about immigration such as Lynn Nottage&iquest;s Intimate Apparel and Lin Manuel Miranda&iquest;s Hamilton&iquest;the latter a show that exemplifies how  art, activism and racial justice come together--the cross-cast musical gave paid opportunities and leading parts to a full cast of performers of color while also recasting the history of immigration in the United States and produced a new form of hip hop.  We will read work by James Baldwin and more!  We will visit the Tenement Museum as well as the Schomburg museum and archive and meet with current curators and arts professionals from across the city.",

        "description": "The course proposes a broad theoretical as well as an experiential and immersive introduction to some of the most urgent issues surrounding institutional responses to gender based violence (GBV) and related forms of gender discrimination today.n nThe course is divided into three main sections: a theoretical framework that introduces students to contemporary arguments and ideas around gender equality, violence, women's empowerment, and legal protections offered under international and domestic law; a critical overview of contemporary New York City and State actors' interventions against gender discrimination, such as the Governor's 2019 Women's Justice Agenda, the Mayor's She Built NYC campaign, and the NYC4CEDAW Act Coalition's campaign for a NYC ordinance for the implementation of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; and a series of thematic case studies that focus on specific challenges including in the areas of reproductive rights, sexual assault, sex work, trafficking and the rights of people of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities.n nThe latter section will require engagement with actors that are instrumental in responding to and preventing gender based violence, and may include, Victor Madrigal-Borloz the UN Independent Expert on Protection against Violence and Discrimination based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, Sgt. Greg Accomando of the NYPD Special Victim's Division, Abagail Nelson the Senior Vice President for Programs at Episcopal Relief &amp; Development, and Deborah Hayashi of the North Central Bronx Sexual Assault Response Team. n nThrough these frameworks and studies, the course offers a well-rounded introduction to the complexity of interventions against gender based discrimination in the context of a Global City. The transnational scope of the course is anchored by New York City as an incubator and instigator for innovative interventions against gender inequality, and there will be an emphasis on the cross-pollination that occurs between the City, State and national and international NGO platforms.",
