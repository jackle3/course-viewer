        "title": "Intro to English III: Latinx Literature (COMPLIT 165, ENGLISH 12D, FEMGEN 12D)",
        "description": "Emerging from the demographic, political, and cultural shifts of the late twentieth century, LatinX Literature flourishes in the twenty-first century as a hemispherically American corpus of texts. Like both ChicanX and Puerto Rican literatures before it, LatinX Literature emerges from various movements for social justice to challenge both the Anglo and the Hispanic established literary traditions of the Americas. As a transnational, pluralistic, heterogeneous, and dynamic category that considers the writings of diverse peoples with cultural ties to Latin America residing in the U.S., it complicates and transgresses the linguistic, geopolitical and cultural borders of the Americas, including those of the Afro-Caribbean, Luso-Brazilian, and the Native First Nations. Aligning itself with the issues, styles, and topics of the Global South, LatinX Literature is a product of the kind of 'border thinking' that critic Walter Mignolo has described as a 'pluriversal epistemology that interconnects the plurality and diversity of decolonial projects.' Acknowledging its emergence from literal and theoretical border spaces and decolonizing epistemologies, the 'X' of LatinX intentionally inflects the link to an origin in LGBTQI discourses signifying 'a more inclusive, non-gender-binary designation for LatinX peoples' and as a border literature that articulates heterogeneous ways of making meaning.

        "description": "The seminar introduces students to major themes connected to the immigrant experience, including identity, education, assimilation, transnationalism, political membership, and intergroup relations. There will also be some attention given to research methodology. The seminar addresses these themes through reading ethnographies that document the everyday experience of immigrants and immigrant communities, broadly defined, in the United States. The course readings primarily come from more contemporary ethnographic research, but it will also include a sampling of ethnographies that examine the experience of previous waves of immigrants. Student participation will include in-class discussions of readings, short written responses to readings, and a final paper in which students draw on original ethnographic research that they conduct during the quarter. By the end of the quarter, students will be able to identify the social, political, and economic forces that shape the immigrant experience. More importantly, students will understand HOW these forces enter the immigrant experience in everyday life.",

Introduction to Latinx studies examines the international processes (e.g., wars of imperialism, colonialism, immigration, migration, legislative policies) as central forces in the formation of U.S. Latinx communities, including the historical influences of Caribbean, Central and South American cultures in American society. This global perspective will accompany a more specific focus on the relationship between Latinx culture and American society, the dynamic role of women in the shaping of Latinx communities, and origins and place of Latin American-diasporic communities in U.S. society. Through an interdisciplinary scholarly lens and archival research, we analyze the history of Latinx migration, immigration, and the social justice and civil rights leaders and organizations who advocated for full citizenship rights. We study artists and the spaces where Latinx art has been transformative across cultures, the nation, and international spaces. We analyze the Latinx diasporic communities and trace their journeys across borders and advocacy for civil rights. Our discussions will include a history and analysis of language, art, music, folktales, and tools that shape the Latinx community. Including Latinx ingenuity, innovation, and major contributions in the sciences, humanities among other fields. Students will read an assortment of foundational humanities and social science literature on the U.S. Latinx experience as well as strengthen writing abilities, sharpen critical thinking skills, and develop archival research proficiencies.",

It focuses on the intersections of race, Indigeneity, and cultural heritage. Since European contact, race has been a key category for governing heterogenous populations across the region. In recent decades, institutions have established cultural heritage formation - particularly the cultural heritages of Black and Indigenous peoples - as central to the development of the modern nation-state. At the same time, Black and Indigenous peoples have mobilized around civil and human rights to decolonize racial hierarchies and transform colonial structures of power. Students will first engage current approaches to race, Indigeneity, and cultural heritage. Students will then explore how racial and Indigenous formations converge with the following cultural heritage forms: museums, tourism, archaeological sites, and language.",

As we consider the origins and persistence of educational inequalities in relation to longstanding forms of violence, domination, and subordination, we will also highlight histories of activism and resistance, including organized struggles for educational justice in Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x communities. Issues to be addressed include school (de)segregation, standardized testing, educational tracking, unequal opportunities to learn, deficit perspectives, bilingualism and bilingual education, immigration and undocumented students, ethnic studies curricula, and culturally relevant/responsive/sustaining approaches to pedagogy.

We will also identify how different ways of arranging events, visuals, and words reconfigure the relationships between the past, present, and future.

Topics include the U.S./Mexico border and the borderlands; (im)migration and diaspora; literary and cultural traditions; music and expressive practices; labor and structural inequality; social movements; Latinx urbanism; gender and sexuality; political and economic shifts; and inter- and intra-group relations.

Often considered distinct fields, we will explore the ways they merge together, and engage in dialogue with an array of guests from a multitude of backgrounds.nn In addition to learning about the Hostile Terrain94 project through tagging the identities of lives of those lost along the Sonoran desert and considering the U.S. policy of prevention through deterrence to crossing the U.S. Mexican Border, this class will explore art making with paper as the primary media. Paper with its material qualities can provide diverse and accessible entryways into the processes of inclusion, recordation, and mass participation. Through the interconnecting of the practical task of filling information onto toe tags to create the exhibition at the Anderson Collection, which documents the human remains of migrants identified for the exhibition (Fall 2020) with creating new objects in paper, the projects in this course will discover and recover identity through articulations of identity in paper.",

Latin America has become a nexus for social justice work, as we respond to the humanitarian crisis along the U.S.-M&eacute;xico Border. To improve identification methods of the undocumented dead, we must understand the diversity in Latinx people and adopt best scientific practices. This course provides a cross-disciplinary, bio-cultural approach to Latin American variation and training in applied methods of forensic anthropology. Explore how tools of biological and cultural anthropology are used jointly in human rights investigation and social justice advancement. Discover the breadth of Latinx diversity and how historical, geographic, and socio-cultural factors shape this variation. Gain hands-on experience in case analysis, using skeletal, genetic, and recovery context information to estimate key parameters of identity. Use case studies to contextualize this work through an intersectional lens that attends to the living families and the applicable historical, geo-political and socio-cultural conditions.",

In order to cover a plethora of Latinx experiences, it will focus on Mexican, Puerto Rican, Dominican, Central American, and other Latinx communities from the 1840s into present, though it does not adhere to a strict chronological time frame. This course attempts to show the hemispheric nature of Latinx history. It also emphasizes a notion of Latinidad as a contingent historical process. Key themes which survey its complexity include the nature and legacies of imperialism; the politics of peoplehood and citizenship; trans-border connections; the importance of race, class, and gender in defining politics and culture; the emergence of ethnic nationalisms; and the development of urban enclaves. In particular, our class will focus on linking these dynamics to present-day issues and debates.",
