        "title": "Taxes and Business Strategy",
        "description": "Taxes have a direct impact on cash flow and often divert 20% to 40% of the firm's pretax cash flow to the government, making the government one of the largest stakeholders. Taxes also affect a wide variety of business decisions, including the efficient formation of businesses, operational planning across jurisdictions with competing tax regimes, M&amp;A tax structure, the creation of cash and equity compensation plans, and retirement planning (to name a few).  This course first provides a conceptual framework for incorporating taxation into business decisions, linking concepts from accounting, corporate finance, business law, and economics. The course then provides real-world examples to illustrate the impact of tax considerations on earnings and cash flows.  The goal of this course is to provide a foundational understanding of tax consequences and trade-offs that can be adapted across jurisdictions and as tax laws change.",

        "description": "Climate change poses one of the most salient emerging risks &iquest; and opportunities &iquest; to financial markets. This course discusses the fast-moving frontiers of climate finance. It will particularly focus on the role that private markets play in accelerating the growth of the companies facilitating the transition to a carbon-neutral economy. The course will consist of a mix of lectures introducing frameworks and relevant background information, case studies, and guest speakers. There will be two hands-on homework exercises where students evaluate real-world investment opportunities - one at the venture-capital stage and one at the private-equity stage. After taking this course, students will (a) be familiar with the unique challenges of financing climate tech at scale; (b) understand the key climate disclosure requirements, frameworks for financed emissions, and methods for &iquest;impact measurement&iquest;; and (c) develop some practical experience with portfolio allocation for sustainability-focused investment funds. No prior finance knowledge is required.",
