While planetary formation in the real world is a little different, we can use fantastical places and environments from film, television, and literature as conversation starters to discuss real discoveries that have been made about how planets form and evolve over time. The class will focus on the following overarching questions: (1) What conditions are required for habitable planets to form? (2) What types of planets may actually exist, including desert worlds, lava planets, ice planets, and ocean worlds? (3) What kids of life could inhabit such diverse worlds? (3) What types of catastrophic events such as supernovas, asteroid impacts, climate changes can nurture or destroy planetary habitability?

Working with various data sources (measurements made on the ground, in wells, and from satellites) allows us to model the water budget in the valley and explore the recent impacts on freshwater supplies.",

Reforming urban systems to improve the equity, resilience and sustainability of communities will require new collaborative methods of assessment, goal setting, and problem solving across governments, markets, and communities. It will also require academic institutions to develop new models of co-production of knowledge across research, education, and practice. This XYZ course series is designed to immerse students in co-production for social change. The course sequence covers scientific research and ethical reasoning, skillsets in data-driven and qualitative analysis, and practical experience working with local partners on urban challenges that can empower students to drive responsible systems change in their future careers. The Autumn (X) and Winter (Y) courses are focused on basic and advanced skills, respectively, and completion is a prerequisite for participation in the Spring (Z) practicum quarter, which engages teams in real-world projects with Bay Area local governments or community groups. X and Y are composed of four weekly pedagogical components: (A) lectures; (B) writing prompts linked with small group discussion; (C) lab and self-guided tutorials on the R programming language; and (D) R data analysis assignments.

        "description": "Introduction to geophysical methods that can be used for imaging and characterizing groundwater systems. Recurring periods of drought and flooding in California have led state and local water agencies to search for ways to capture flood water and use it to recharge (refill) the over-pumped groundwater systems. The course this year will be structured around analyzing a new geophysical data set to identify optimal locations for recharge. The data set: 26,000 kilometers of electromagnetic data, acquired with a helicopter-deployed system, which image the groundwater systems of the Valley to a depth of ~300 m. We will analyze these data to find optimal sites for recharge by mapping out the variation in sediment type and identifying pathways for flow. Pre-requisite: CME 100 or Math 51, or co-registration in either.",

        "description": "(Formerly GEOLSCI 306) The ability to present your research in a compelling, concise, and engaging manner will enhance your professional career. I will work to convince you that the best way to capture an audience and leave a lasting impression is to tell a story, do a demo, or pick a fight. The goal of a talk is not to show people how much work you did, how capable and dedicated you are, or how much you know. Instead, we want to learn something new and important, something that changes our perspective and influences our research. We want to be inspired, shocked, or moved. In the opening minutes of a talk, you must plant your flag and make your case. You are forecasting the arc of your story, rather than introducing your topic. If, for example, your very first words are, &quot;I will argue,&quot; you're on a good path. In these crucial opening minutes, you've either hooked them or lost them. The course is taught as a series of stand-and-deliver exercises with feedback from other students and revisiona on the fly. You'll do exercises on talk openers and closers, physical demos, conference talks, job interviews, press interviews, and funding pitches. We also tackle scientific graphics, focusing on builder slides and posters. Special guests will enrich the course, including a graphic designer, Adobe Illustrator mavens, headhunters, entrepreneurs, and TV reporters. This is a 'flipped' class, so there are no lectures. Instead, students receive Class Notes before each week's classes, and a Postscript Letter afterwards. Grades are completely optional: 70% in-class exercises, 30% final presentation, such as your upcoming conference presentations. My pledge is that everyone will come away a more skilled and confident speaker than they were before. Anonymous 2022 Course Evaluation Comments: &quot;Truly the best course that I have taken in my life. There is simply an incredible amount of wisdom to be gained from this course. To no exaggeration, your life will be changed, and you will forever see presentations differently after this experience of a lifetime. It's also accessible to undergrads as long as you have a research project.&quot; &quot;By far, the best class I've taken at Stanford. Will change your entire perspective on presenting research.&quot; &quot;This is by far the best and most helpful course I have taken in all 5 years at Stanford. This course is really a must for anyone and has given me a huge confidence boost for public speaking in all scenarios. Ross is a fantastic instructor and makes the class a welcoming and collaborative environment.&quot; &quot;Ross is an engaging teacher with years of experience doing public speaking in academic, government, and business settings. This class is well worth the time that it takes to prepare the short talk exercises. Highly recommend this class for anyone looking to improve their speaking skills.&quot; Change of Department Name: Earth and Planetary Science (Formerly Geologic Sciences).",

Reforming urban systems to improve the equity, resilience and sustainability of communities will require new collaborative methods of assessment, goal setting, and problem solving across governments, markets, and communities. It will also require academic institutions to develop new models of co-production of knowledge across research, education, and practice. This XYZ course series is designed to immerse students in co-production for social change. The course sequence covers scientific research and ethical reasoning, skillsets in data-driven and qualitative analysis, and practical experience working with local partners on urban challenges that can empower students to drive responsible systems change in their future careers. The Autumn (X) and Winter (Y) courses are focused on basic and advanced skills, respectively, and completion is a prerequisite for participation in the Spring (Z) practicum quarter, which engages teams in real-world projects with Bay Area local governments or community groups. X and Y are composed of four weekly pedagogical components: (A) lectures; (B) writing prompts linked with small group discussion; (C) lab and self-guided tutorials on the R programming language; and (D) R data analysis assignments.

This course offers a quantitative examination of both exogenous processes - such as impact cratering and space weathering - and endogenous processes  - such as tectonics, weathering, and volcanic, fluvial, eolian, and periglacial activity - as well as a brief introduction to the fundamentals of remote sensing in the context of planetary exploration. As we develop a basic mechanistic framework for these processes, we will apply our acquired knowledge through thematic discussions of the surfaces of Mercury, Venus, Earth, the Moon, Mars, asteroids, Io, Titan, Europa, Enceladus, Pluto, and comets.
