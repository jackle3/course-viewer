        "description": "Six quarter series extending throughout the first two years of the MD program, interweaving core skills training in medical interviewing and the physical examination with other major threads addressing the context of medical practice: information literacy, nutrition principles, clinical epidemiology and biostatistics, evidence-based practice, psychiatry, biomedical ethics, health policy, population health. Core clinical skills are acquired through hands-on practice, and evaluated through an extensive program of simulated medical encounters, in which students interview, examine, and manage patients in a mock clinic. The information literacy thread introduces students to informatics and knowledge management, biomedical informatics, and evidence-based medicine searching. Nutrition principles are acquired through interactive, web-based instruction, and reinforced through problem-based learning cases, which run in parallel to the basic science components over the first year. In epdemiology students learn the taxonomy of epidemiological studies, how to critically read a journal article, and how to recognize and understand the concepts behind different clinical study designs. Topics include bias, confounding, diagnostic testing and screening, and &quot;how statistics can lie.&quot; Psychiatry introduces students to the unique role of medical students in talking with patients, the difference between process and content in patient communication, how to respond to breaks in the patient-physician relationship, and the relationship between the quality of the patient-physician interaction and health outcomes. Health care policy covers such topics as health insurance, physician payment, health care costs, access, measurement and improvement of quality, regulation and health care reform. Biomedical ethics includes important ethical issues in medical practice, such as confidentiality, privacy, and ethical issues relating to medical students. The population health curriculum exposes students to concepts of public health, community action, and advocacy, and includes a year-long, community-based project. At the end of this quarter students participate in a performance-based assessment of the medical interview skills.nCourse offered to MD and MSPA students only.",

        "description": "(Crosslisted with GSBGEN 368). This elective 3-unit course is offered to all medical students, residents, and fellows and other graduate students with instructor's permission who aspire to improve their ability to deal effectively with difficult professional and personal interpersonal situations. Class is held Tuesday, 3:10-6:10 PM. The course will be taught by William F. Meehan III, the Raccoon Partners Lecturer in Management and Senior Partner Emeritus, McKinsey and Company, and Charles G. Prober, M.D., Professor of Pediatrics, Microbiology &amp; Immunology and Senior Associate Vice Provost for Health Education, Stanford School of Medicine. The course, which is case/vignette-based, involves frequent student-to-student and student-to-instructor role-playing in authentic business and medical interactions. Inde 238 is cross-listed with GSBGEN 368 which draws MBA students, and part of the learning environment of the course is the mix of perspectives and vignettes we role play and discuss.  Topic-specific experts often will be present to participate as class guests. Relevant principles of professionalism, leadership, and psychology underlie the course pedagogy. Students will be expected to attend all classes unless excused in advance. Class preparation will include reading of assigned cases; analysis of the cases and recommendations as to how to confront specific difficult conversations (consistent with assigned study questions); and reading of assigned background material. It is important that all students participate actively in classroom discussions. Class size will be limited to 40 students per the following: (1) a maximum of 20 MBA students and (2) a maximum of 20 non-GSB graduate students. MD student enrollment only in INDE 238, GSB students enroll under GSBGEN 368. Please email Dr. Prober or Professor Meehan directly if you have any questions.",

Students take part in online curriculum that is differentiated into 3 proficiency levels, therefore all levels of learners from beginners to native speakers are encouraged to participate. The online content covers over 36 medical specialties to provide a broad base of clinically relevant knowledge. The platform has validated pedagogy to meet the needs of individual learners with clinical scenarios that are relevant to medical engagements across all disciplines and inclusive of a culturally relevant approach to clinical care. Subspecialty faculty will lead the language workshops: Dr. Reena Thomas, Clinical Associate Professor of Neurology; Dr. Matias Bruzoni, Associate Professor of Surgery; Dr. Katherine Bianco, Clinical Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology; Dr. Felipe Perez, Clinical Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology; Dr. Cesar Padilla Clinical Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology. Dr. Cesar Padilla will also be leading standardize patient encounters for students to practice their medical Spanish skills.",

In addition to contributing to the care of patients, students participate in didactics and debrief in small group sessions to reflect on their early patient experiences and professional identity formation. This course fulfills the ECE graduation requirement for students who complete one quarter. Students who participate in INDE 280 will have priority for continuity preceptor placement in Ambulatory Medicine, Family Medicine, Geriatrics, and Palliative Care specialties as MS2+. Students co-enrolled in INDE 290 attend the INDE 290 didactics to meet the course didactic requirement. Open to Medical Students only.",

Each month we explore a different health systems science topic through expert lectures incorporating the perspectives of patients and family caregivers, with time to engage in discussion and explore person-centered solutions to real-world problems. Students are paired with a patient partner for 3 quarters and meet 2 to 3 times each quarter outside of class to explore the patient experience, in clinical and non-clinical settings according to shared interests and schedules. This course fulfills the ECE requirement for first-year medical students.

Two-year curriculum designed to provide structured time for students to step back from clerkships, in order to promote reflection on and reinforcement for their learning in the clinical environment. The goals of this course are: to offer a regular opportunity for students to discuss challenging issues faced in their clinical training; to ground students in strategies for managing challenging situations they are likely to experience in their personal and professional lives while on clerkships; and to provide opportunities for students to develop and expand their reflective and communication skills. Components of this curriculum include the &quot;Doctoring with CARE&quot; small groups, the &quot;MeD-ReST&quot; Medical Student Resiliency Skills Training' sessions, and the &quot;Contextual Medicine: Communication, Connection and Creativity in Practice&quot; lunch and lecture series. All students in clinical clerkships must participate in all aspects of RCM Days. Students enrolled in Selective II Clerkships (Sub-internships) may choose to participate in clinical duties but are expected to communicate their absence to course faculty/staff in advance. Prerequisite: Concurrent enrollment in clinical clerkships. Please note, students will enroll in this course their final quarter of enrollment prior to graduation to receive retroactive credit for all session. Only enroll the last quarter of enrollment.",
