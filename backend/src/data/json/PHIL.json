Can randomness help us answer difficult questions more accurately or more efficiently? What is randomness anyway? Can an object be random? Are there genuinely random processes in the world, and if so, how can we tell?  In this seminar, we will explore these questions through the lenses of philosophy and computation. By the end of the quarter students should have an appreciation of the many roles that randomness plays in both humanities and sciences, as well as a grasp of some of the key analytical tools used to study the concept.  The course will be self-contained, and no prior experience with randomness/probability is necessary.",

What is a mind, and what is the nature of experience?  How can we know what the world is like?

What assumptions about freedom do we make when we hold people accountable morally and/or legally? When we hold  people accountable, and so responsible, can we also see them as part of the natural, causal order?  Or is there a deep incompatibility between these two ways of understanding ourselves?  What assumptions about our freedom do we make when we deliberate about what to do?  Are these assumptions in conflict with seeing ourselves as part of the natural, causal order?We will explore these and related questions primarily by way of careful study of recent and contemporary philosophical research on these matters.",

How can a country like the United States justify forcefully preventing anyone from crossing its borders? Is anything absolutely prohibited to win a war? When examining such issues, we need to start with facts&iquest;facts about poverty, inequality, climate change, immigration, etc. After surveying the basic facts, we will use philosophical readings to focus and deepen our discussions of what justice requires across borders.

How could we know if it had been achieved? Is there a chance that we ourselves are artificial intelligences? Would artificial intelligences, under certain conditions, actually be persons? If so, how would that affect how they ought to be treated and what ought to be expected of them? Emerging technologies with impressive capacities already seem to function in ways we do not fully understand. What are the opportunities and dangers that this presents? How should the promises and hazards of these technologies be managed?Philosophers have studied questions much like these for millennia, in scholarly debates that have increased in fervor with advances in psychology, neuroscience, and computer science. The philosophy of mind provides tools to carefully address whether genuine artificial intelligence and artificial personhood are possible. Epistemology (the philosophy of knowledge) helps us ponder how we might be able to know. Ethics provides concepts and theories to explore how all of this might bear on what ought to be done. We will read philosophical writings in these areas as well as writings explicitly addressing the questions about artificial intelligence, hoping for a deep and clear understanding of the difficult philosophical challenges the topic presents.No background in any of this is presupposed, and you will emerge from the class having made a good start learning about computational technologies as well as a number of fields of philosophical thinking. It will also be a good opportunity to develop your skills in discussing and writing critically about complex issues.",

We will focus on the moral and political issues that affect the world of sport and which athletes, coaches, sports commentators and fans are faced with. For instance, we will ask questions such as: what is a fair game (the ethics of effort, merit, success)? Is it ethical to train people to use violence (the ethics of martial arts)? Are divisions by gender categories justified and what should we think of gender testing? Is the use of animals in sport ever justified? Which forms of performance enhancements are acceptable in sport (the ethics of drug use and enhancements through technologies)? Should we ban sports that damage the players&iquest; health? Does society owe social support to people who hurt themselves while practicing extreme sports? nnThe class will be structured around small group discussions and exercises as well as brief lectures to introduce key moral and political concepts (such as fairness, equality, freedom, justice, exploitation, etc.). I will also bring guests speakers who are involved in a sport activity at Stanford or who have worked on sports as part of their academic careers. By the end of the seminar, students will have a good understanding of the various ethical challenges that surround the world of sport. They will be able to critically discuss sport activities, norms, modes of assessments and policies (on campus and beyond). They will also be prepared to apply the critical ethical thinking that they will have deployed onto other topics than sports. They will have been introduced to the normative approach to social issues, which consists in asking how things should be rather than describing how things are. They will be prepared to take more advanced classes in ethics, political theory, as well as moral and political philosophy.",

The aim of this course is to provide a broad-ranging, general introduction to a wide range of topics including justice, race, gender, metaphysics and more through a philosophical exploration of some of the ideas that have shaped and are currently shaping our world today, and what that means for our evolving understanding of freedom, to be &quot;purely at home with ourselves.&quot;",

Marcus Allen no longer plays for the Raiders and neither do any of his teammates. The Raiders have since moved from LA to Oakland to Las Vegas and ownership has passed from Al Davis to Mark Davis. Despite this, they&iquest;re still the Raiders and they&iquest;re still, in some sense, the same team as the 1983 Superbowl champions. In a similar vein the Washington Commanders claim a 90 year history, despite having recently changed their name and jersey. In what sense can we say these teams are the same throughout their history? In this tutorial we will think about philosophy *through* sports: we will explore classic philosophical problems - like the one above - as they arise in sports such as baseball, soccer, basketball, and more. We will not be asking about the nature of sports or about the ethics of sports, rather we will see how everyday aspects of sports can give rise to puzzling abstract questions. If you see the world as larger version of your favorite sport, then this is the philosophy class for you. No background in philosophy needed to be successful in the course.",

Philosophical work in social epistemology recognizes that knowledge is usually dependent on a range of social institutions, practices, and relations, and considers how these social dimensions of knowledge should be theorized. Feminist social epistemology goes further, arguing that the oppression that characterizes social relations also shapes epistemic practices, norms, and institutions. A distinctive feature of feminist social epistemology is its combination of descriptive and normative elements. Feminist accounts typically begin by identifying features of actual epistemic systems that affect who counts as a knower and what counts as knowledge. This descriptive account is then used to guide the development of norms and recommendations for action. In this class we will begin with a brief history of feminist epistemology before critically examining contemporary work on testimony and ignorance.",

AI programs drive cars without a license; robots offer sexual services in exchange for payment; autonomous weapons systems roam around, looking to kill with impunity. With this new frontier comes significant ethical issues. There are several clusters of questions for us to consider, including most pressing: which technologies are permissible to develop and implement? Second, under the heading of what philosophers sometimes call moral 'agenthood': what would make robots themselves count as agents, and to what standards are they responsible? Finally, under the heading of moral 'patienthood': in what ways can robots be benefited or harmed, and how does this impact humanity's ethical obligations? Each week, our discussion will be framed around a pair of assignments: a short story, TV episode, or video; and a philosophical text. As we move through the course, the questions above will be tackled in the context of specific emerging technologies, such as self-driving cars, autonomous weapons, sex robots, and more.

How should agents reason together about important questions determining how we live together? At what should such reasoning aim?  Can on-line communities/collaborations like various sub-reddits and Wikipedia provide a model for how we can reason/live together?  How does collective reasoning go well and when can it close?

The central questions we will try to answer together concern when we should put our heads together to solve problems, how we can do so effectively, and what technological developments might offer by way of aid and impediment to responsible and effective collaboration.Our exploration of these questions will involve various discussions in social and political philosophy, epistemology, tech ethics, and the philosophy of action. We will be drawing on thinkers familiar to the Anglo-American canon, as well as perspectives and approaches drawn from African philosophy, feminist theory, communication studies, and Indigenous American philosophy.",

        "description": "Tutorial taught by grad student. Enrollment limited to 10. Do we have free will? What, exactly, does 'free will' refer to? Does it refer to the ability to do otherwise, holding fixed the facts? That one is the source of one's behavior? Does it refer to something else? Why does it matter whether or not we have 'free will'? In turn, what kind or kinds of control over our conduct should we be interested in, and why? One reason questions about free will matter is that some sort of freedom or control seems to be required in order to fairly hold people responsible for how they have behaved -- for praise and blame, rewards and punishments, etc. In that case, is 'free will' simply whatever sort of control over our conduct would make sense of holding one another, and ourselves, responsible? Or, rather, do we have an independent conception of 'free will' that props up our practices of holding one another responsible, such that if it turns out that we don't have 'free will,' no one is ever really responsible for their behavior? In this tutorial we will explore these and related questions, focusing on developments in these debates in approximately the past 50 years.",

What is the difference between conscious and unconscious mental states? In this class, we'll see how philosophers (Descartes, Locke, Leibniz, Kant) from the early modern period responded to these questions and revolutionized our conception of the mind. Readings will be drawn from both primary texts and secondary literature. Towards the end of the class, we'll connect the historical ideas with some of the most important issues in contemporary philosophy of mind and cognitive science.

What is our relationship to the real world? Can we learn anything from video games about our relationship to the real world, and can we learn anything from philosophy that can help us create compelling video game worlds? In this course we will examine elements of video game design and development in the context of related philosophical topics including the nature of worlds, the nature of the mind, and the nature of action. For example, while some games are open-world, some consist of a set of sandboxes, and could the distinction between what philosophers call 'possible worlds' and 'situations' help us understand the difference? (Or vice versa?) Video game worlds are often sprinkled with 'pick-ups' -- do philosophical accounts of how agents perceive the real world help to explain why this is such an intuitive game mechanic? In this course we will play and tinker with video games while also reading philosophical texts, and see if each domain can stimulate our thinking about the other. There are no prerequisites for this course, but all students should come prepared to read challenging literature, to play some games, and to make some games!",

But one might think that there are also other ways of explaining and predicting a person's behavior. For example, one might appeal to facts about a person's competencies, habits, biases, etc. By thinking philosophically about what kinds of facts these are and about what form of explaination they provide, we can broaden our philosophical understanding of how we explain and predict each other's behavior.",

Does thinking count as action? What counts as &quot;overthinking&quot;? Why have sages and religious traditions embraced living as simply as possible?

Can we argue an avowed amoralist into caring about morality? If so, on what basis? What is morality telling us to do, anyway? In this course, we will make a preliminary investigation of these questions and of some important historical and contemporary attempts to answer them. We will also look at some possible sources for skepticism about morality: What if we are, in the end, wholly selfish animals? What if the correct account of the origins of our moral beliefs ends up undermining them? Does the role of luck in our lives undercut our basic notion of ourselves as responsible for our actions?

Question examined will include: Should values be involved in accepting or rejecting scientific hypotheses? Are certain scientific categories value laden? Are there scientific topics that should be deprioritized or not pursued at all in a society? How should scientists communicate socially important but uncertain information to the policy makers and the public? The second part of the course focuses on the scientific method and how it contributes to the success and progress of science. We will examine three different accounts of the scientific method, accounts that lead to different conceptions of the nature and growth of scientific knowledge: The hypothetical-deductive view; Thomas Kuhn's account of normal science and scientific revolutions; and finally, an account of theory testing by George Smith, a leading scholar on Isaac Newton. Throughout the course, we will examine the philosophical ideas in the light of concrete cases in the history and practice of science.

        "description": "This course will serve as a first introduction to the formal tools and techniques of contemporary philosophy, including probability and formal logic. Traditionally, philosophy is an attempt to systematically tackle foundational problems related to value, inquiry, mind and reality. Contemporary philosophy continuesthis tradition of critical thinking with modern subject matter (often engaging with natural, social and mathematical science) and modern rigorous methods, including the methods of set theory, probability theory and formal logic. The aim of this course is to introduce such methods, along with various core philosophical distinctions and motivations. The focus will be on basic conceptual underpinnings and skills, not technical details. The material covered is also useful preparation for certain topics in mathematics, computer science, linguistics, economics and statistics. No previous philosophical or mathematical training is presupposed, though an appreciation of precise thinking is an advantage.",

We will begin by exploring core debates on aesthetic experience, aesthetic properties, and aesthetic value. But we will also venture into considerations of aesthetics in our everyday lives, aesthetic taste and our personalities, aesthetics and grief, aesthetics and gender, and aesthetics and race. By the end of the quarter, you will have a strong foundation in understanding this rich aspect of life we call aesthetics.",

Here are a few of the questions that will be explored: People are encouraged to become kidney donors, but we still don't have enough kidneys for everybody who needs one. Should you be allowed to sell a kidney? Suppose Robert is dying of a rare disease and the only thing that could save his life is a bone marrow transplant from his cousin David, but David doesn't want to donate. Should we force him to &quot;donate&quot;? Some people say a woman should be free to make abortion decisions on whatever grounds she wants, including prenatal genetic testing for conditions like Down syndrome; others condemn such selective abortion as an unacceptable form of eugenics. What genetic testing information, if any, should be allowed to influence a woman's decision about whether to terminate a pregnancy? In addition to these normative questions, we will also study related questions in constitutional law. When the Supreme Court decided that abortion was a constitutional right in Roe v. Wade, on what legal reasoning did they base their decision? When they decided to overturn Roe in the recent Dobbs v. Jackson, what legal reasoning did they use then? How will Dobbs affect other (current) constitutional rights?",

        "description": "As we live in a globalized world, our lives are interconnected with many other people within and beyond the state borders. Currently, we face urgent problems of global justice, such as climate change, economic inequality, immigration, and health disparities, and how to address these issues is a crucial question for all of us. This course introduces students to normative inquiries into issues of global justice and offers an opportunity to integrate theories and practices by engaging with essential and timely questions. What normative demands does justice impose on individuals and institutions in a global world? Do people in affluent countries bear the responsibility for the suffering of those who live in other countries? Should relatively developed countries open their borders to those from developing countries? How should we allocate responsibilities for reducing global injustice, such as health disparities? How does injustice with historical roots, such as colonialism, further complicate the picture of normative demands? While there are no easy answers to these questions, throughout this course, students will be exposed to interdisciplinary approaches (including philosophy, political theory, gender studies, etc.), learn to critically analyze various theoretical approaches, and use them as frameworks to develop their views on issues of global justice. Please note that in addition to the listed lecture time, students must sign up for a 45-min discussion session. The schedule of the discussion session will be announced during the first week of the quarter.",

In exploring these questions, we will also have the chance to discuss God's relation to time, the possibility of reconciling divine omniscience with human free will, the epistemology of testimony and religious disagreement, the relationship between faith and reason, Aquinas' five ways, voluntarism and divine command theory, and the problem of evil. No prior experience in philosophy of religion or theology more generally will be presupposed - and students of all faith backgrounds (or no faith background!) are welcome. Readings will primarily draw on contemporary analytic philosophy of religion, though we will also look at historical works of philosophical theology from both Western and non-Western sources. Interested students are invited to contact the instructor for more information.",

        "description": "Much work in philosophy of religion deals with metaphysical questions related to theism, beginning with the question whether God exists. Those are important and difficult issues (and receive treatment in other courses in the philosophy department). In this class, we will set those questions aside in order directly to examine the experiences, attitudes, and practices that characterize many forms of religious life. In particular, we will look at the three so-called &quot;theological virtues&quot; - faith, hope, and love - along with related practices of worship, prayer, and forgiveness. We will also consider the significance of suffering in different religious traditions. The questions we take up will include the following: What does it mean to have faith in God, and can that be reasonable? What would be the point of praying to an all-knowing God? Why is forgiveness especially prominent in religious contexts, and what does it look like to love your neighbor - or your enemy? Is there something problematic about worshiping God? And do religious hopes amount to abandoning our current stations? No prior experience in philosophy is required. Prerequisites: none",

The readings address condoned violence broadly understood, covering a wide array of practices that produce suffering, but are considered justifiable to one degree or another by states or societies: judicial punishment, incarceration, the death penalty, pornography, and industrial farming practices, among others. We shall not discuss war, but will focus instead on domestic phenomena. By considering how such forms of violence are justified, the course aims to critically approach the notion that human societies are generally moving towards greater kindness and empathy. This seminar will bring together texts from political theory and political philosophy, legal theory, comparative politics, alongside several other cultural attach&eacute;s.

        "description": "Can novels make us better people? Can movies challenge our assumptions? Can poems help us become who we are? We'll think about these and other questions with the help of writers like Toni Morrison, Marcel Proust, Jordan Peele, Charlie Kaufman, Rachel Cusk, William Shakespeare, and Samuel Beckett, plus thinkers like Nehamas, Nietzsche, Nussbaum, Plato, and Sartre. We'll also ask whether a disenchanted world can be re-enchanted; when, if ever, the truth stops being the most important thing; why we sometimes choose to read sad stories; whether we ever love someone for who they are; who could possibly want to live their same life over and over again; what it takes to make ourselves fully moral; whether it's ever good to be conflicted; how we can pull ourselves together; and how we can take ourselves apart. (This is the required gateway course for the Philosophy and Literature major tracks. Majors should register in their home department.)",

An overview of the interdisciplinary study of cognition, information, communication, and language, with an emphasis on foundational issues: What are minds? What is computation? What are rationality and intelligence? Can we predict human behavior? Can computers be truly intelligent? How do people and technology interact, and how might they do so in the future? Lectures focus on how the methods of philosophy, mathematics, empirical research, and computational modeling are used to study minds and machines. Students must take this course before being approved to declare Symbolic Systems as a major. All students interested in studying Symbolic Systems are urged to take this course early in their student careers. The course material and presentation will be at an introductory level, without prerequisites. If you have any questions about the course, please email symsys1staff@gmail.com.",

        "title": "Normativity in Ancient Greek Metaethics (PHIL 204)",
        "description": "Grads enroll in 204. In this course, we shall examine some basic issues in metaethics in the context of Plato's and Aristotle's philosophy. First-order ethics asks questions such as 'What makes an action right?',  'What are virtues and vices?', 'Do I have, ceteris paribus, a duty to obey the laws?', and 'What is the best theory of social justice?'. Metaethics takes moral or ethical judgments as its subject matter and inquires into their nature. Basic metaethical questions include: 'What do moral or ethical judgments mean?'. When we say 'X is right', do we mean that X is objectively right?', 'Do moral judgments make claims about the world or about how we think about the world?' (These are questions about moral semantics.) Moral judgments, as we'll see, seem to involve the notion of evaluating actions, agents, social practices and so on. They are, in a bit of jargon, normative or evaluative. We'll try to get clearer on what such normativity involves by considering two other fundamental sort of metaethical questions. The first concerns the possibility of moral knowledge, includes questions such as 'Can we ever know if a moral claim is true and, if so, how can we know this?', 'In mathematics, chemistry, the history of India, and chess, for example, we think that there are experts who know more than we do and that we should, at least to some extent, defer to their judgments in their areas of expertise. Can there be moral experts to whom we should defer in the same way?' (These are questions about moral epistemology.) Yet other metaethical questions concern the place of morality in the world. Such questions include 'Are moral properties such rightness and wrongness &quot;out there&quot; in the world as we might think mass and electrical charge are (or being a neuron)?', 'Or are moral properties really just properties of our attitudes and beliefs?', 'Or do they simply not exist in the way that there is nothing that is phlogiston or Santa?' (Sorry). We'll start by reading some basic literature in contemporary metaethics and then turn to take up these questions in the context of Plato and Aristotle. By reading our ancient authors carefully, we'll try to work out the differences and similarities between their questions and answers and our own. I'm organizing the course so that both students who've done a good deal of work in metaethics and ancient philosophy and those who have done none at all will both be able to learn from the readings, the lectures, and what I hope will be lively classroom discussions.",

We will carefully examine the work and its contributions to Platonic metaphysics, physics, psychology, teleology, cosmology, and theology. In so doing, we will also consider questions of how we are to understand it as a likely story, its role within the Platonic corpus, and its engagement with pre-existing traditions of Greek natural philosophy.",

Topics to be covered are especially epistemology, ethics, and physics, but will also include metaphysics, psychology, cosmology, ontology, and logic.",

        "description": "Philosophers have wondered what it is like to be an animal (the question of animal consciousness) and what we owe animals (animal ethics).  But how do we understand these nonhuman animals in the first place?  How do they act, and interact with one another?  What are their lived environments?  How does our concept of the animal shape our concept of the human being?  In this course, we will try to answer these questions by exploring the work of thinkers who have made major contributions to how we understand nonhuman animals including Aristotle, Darwin, Heidegger, Uexk&uuml;ll, Merleau-Ponty, Derrida, Deleuze and Guattari. This course is intended for students who have completed either 2 classes in philosophy or 1 class in philosophy at the 100+ level.  Permission to enroll without meeting these requirements may be granted in certain circumstances.",

Who is (or ought to be) a citizen? Who gets to decide? What responsibilities come with citizenship? Is being a citizen analogous to being a friend, a family member, a business partner? How can citizenship be gained, and can it ever be lost? These debates figure in the earliest recorded political philosophy but also animate contemporary political debates. This class uses ancient, medieval, and modern texts to examine these questions and different answers given over time. We&iquest;&Auml;&ocirc;ll pay particular attention to understandings of democratic citizenship but look at non-democratic citizenship as well. Students will develop and defend their own views on these questions, using the class texts as foundations. No experience with political philosophy is required or expected, and students can expect to learn or hone the skills (writing / reading / analysis) of political philosophy.",

After introducing general ideas of induction and recursion, we will study a bit of elementary (axiomatic) set theory before then covering basic definability theory, viz. assessing the theoretical limits of what can and cannot be expressed in a first-order language. The centerpiece result of the class is the completeness - and closely related compactness - of first-order logic, a result with a number of momentous consequences, some useful, some philosophically puzzling. We will then study a connection with game theory, whereby a certain type of game characterizes precisely the expressive power of first-order logic. Further topics may include: the 0-1 law in finite model theory, second-order logic, and the algebraic approach to logic. Prerequisite: 150 or consent of instructor.",

        "description": "This course is devoted to understanding the limits of (formalized, or at least formalizable) mathematical proof. As we will see, the subject is closely tied to the foundations of computation and computability. We will therefore spend the first half of the quarter establishing a solid framework for theorizing about the scope and limits of what can, in principle, be computed. We then turn to arithmetic as a canonical case study, working up to the famous incompleteness theorems of K. G&ouml;del. Finally, at the end we will discuss the philosophical repercussions of these results, centering the discussion around a dilemma known as G&ouml;del's disjunction: roughly, either the human mind is somehow non-algorithmic, or there must be mathematical truths that are, in a very strong sense, essentially beyond our ability to ascertain or prove.Prerequisite: 151/251.",

This course introduces some mathematical tools to answer this broad question (expected utility theory, choice theory, and voting theory) along with their philosophical motivations, uses, and limitations. Assessment will consist mainly of problem sets which include both math problems and short essays.  Prerequisite: PHIL 150.",

        "description": "Our intuitions about the nature of organisms and of individuals are challenged by numerous puzzle cases in recent biological science. The nature of individuals is of long-standing interest in philosophy (as well as in different branches of the sciences). However, ideas of biological individuality have been challenged by developments in a variety of subfields of biology, and related areas including, for example, evolutionary biology, developmental biology, microbiology, and immunology. These challenges invite us to present a traditional philosophical thread discussion with new and exciting puzzles. In this course, we will read and discuss papers and book excerpts from both historical and contemporary authors working on biological individuality, which is often spearheaded by the use of case studies. The course will begin with a select history of how the particular problem(s) of biological individuality developed. Having established a shared understanding of the range of questions and perspectives available, students will gain a common language to communicate about this topic with those working in other fields. A background in biology is not necessary to take this course, and we will only visit traditional philosophical conceptions of individuality insofar as they are illuminating for the cases and readings we cover. Students are welcome from the humanities and sciences alike with the opportunity to come together over a philosophical topic that has consequences both within philosophy and beyond.",

A close critical study of the main modern accounts of metaphor's nature and interest, drawing on the work of writers, linguists, philosophers, and literary critics. Attention to how understanding, appreciation, and pleasure connect with one another in the experience of metaphor. Consideration of the possibility that metaphor or something very like it occurs in nonverbal media: gesture, dance, painting, music.",

        "description": "Justice, as we use the term in this class, is a question about social cooperation. People can produce much more cooperatively than the sum of what they could produce as individuals, and these gains from cooperation are what makes civilization possible. But on what terms should we cooperate? How should we divide, as the philosopher John Rawls puts it, &quot;the benefits and burdens of social cooperation&quot;? Working primarily within the Anglo-American philosophical tradition, we'll discuss different answers to this big question as a way to bring together some of the most prominent debates in modern political philosophy. We'll study theories including utilitarianism, libertarianism, classical liberalism, and egalitarian liberalism, and we'll take on complex current issues like reparations for racial injustice, the gender pay gap, and responses to climate change. This class is meant to be an accessible entry point to political philosophy. No experience with political science or philosophy is required or assumed, and we will spend time on the strategy of philosophy as well: understanding how our authors make their arguments to better respond to them and make our own.",

What is the proper relationship between the individual, the community, and the state? Are liberty and equality in conflict, and, if so, which should take priority? What does justice mean in a large and diverse modern society? The title of the course, borrowed from a book by Michael Sandel, is 'Liberalism and its Critics' because the questions we discuss in this class center on the meaning of, and alternatives to, the liberal ideas that the basic goal of society should be the protection of individual rights and that some form of an egalitarian democracy is the best way to achieve this goal. The course is structured around two historical phenomena: one the one hand, liberal answers to these key questions have at times seemed politically and socially triumphant, but on the other hand, this ascendency has always been challenged and contested. At least one prior class in political theory, such as Justice (PS 103), Citizenship in the 21st Century (College 102), or Democratic Theory (PS 234) is recommended but not required.",

To be dominated, according to republican political philosophy, is to be subject to the arbitrary or uncontrolled power of another. And to be free is the absence of domination. This view was the dominant political conception of freedom in the western political tradition until the rise of classical liberalism in the 19th century. In this course, we will examine different accounts of domination and freedom in the republican political tradition and critiques of non-domination as a political conception of freedom. We will also examine the contemporary revival of the republican view and its application to social relations ranging from the workplace to the family and beyond (prerequisite: PHIL 80).",

In the second part of the course, we will read about what constitutes oppression, how does it arise, and why women became oppressed; how our ethical and political theories should change to reflect feminist concerns about the status of women in modern society not limiting the latter to only feminist concerns and movements in affluent countries.

Somehow, these marks are conveying to you information about a class that will be offered at Stanford during the winter quarter 2020. But how is this happening? These marks surely have no natural connection to the future class. They aren't like the footprints of a tiger, for example. Additionally, thousands of times a day, you manage to gain information about all manner of subjects by hearing strange sounds that have no natural connection to the subject matter. The sounds aren't like the bark of a dog, for example. You also manage to think about things that aren't in front of you, as when you think of a Hippo wearing a fedora. Yet activity in your brain has no natural connection to Hippos in fedoras (we presume). This class will investigate how it is that sounds, marks, and mental states manage to have semantic content.  In other words, we will discuss attempts to solve the mystery of meaning, in all of its forms.nThe class is open to all graduate students in philosophy.

        "description": "Much of what we know, we know by relying on the testimony of other individuals, groups, traditional news media or social media. The course explores varieties of testimonial knowledge which arise from relaxed everyday testimony ('the coffee machine is broken') and from scientific expert testimony ('Venus is larger than Mars'). The course also touches on issues concerning testimonial injustice - the type of injustice that occurs when someone is wronged in their capacity as a testifier - for example, when their testimony is unjustly devaluated. Finally, we will consider whether philosophical theorizing about testimony may shed light on obstacles for science communication about divisive issues such as vaccines, climate science etc.nnThus, the course is organized around three interrelated themes. 1: Foundational questions, 2: Testimonial injustice and 3: Scientific testimony. Overall, then, the course connects foundational work in epistemology and philosophy of science to some pertinent ethical and political problems.",

An equally foundational (yet thus far undertheorized) requirement is that the mens rea and the actus reus &quot;correspond&quot; - that the defendant's mental states stand in the right relationship to the non-mental elements of the crime. This seminar begins by focusing on the mens rea and actus reus conditions, and then turns to the question of what the required correspondence relation might amount to. Students will gain familiarity with foundational principles (both settled and unsettled) of the Anglo-American criminal legal system as well as with how philosophical methodology and research might be leveraged to shed light on those principles.

On the other hand, if it is not true, then since it says it is not true, what it says is the case. So if the sentence is true it is not true, and if it is not true it is true. This is a version of the Liar Paradox. In this class we'll discuss the liar and other paradoxes, including the paradoxes of set theory, the Sorites Paradox, and several other well-known paradoxes.

But when it comes to others, I can neither form a concept of mind out of their own experiences, nor apply my concept of mind to them, since the criteria I use in my own case cannot be met in the case of others.&quot; We will explore the problem of other minds, and its possible solutions and dissolutions, by reading selected works from both the analytic and continental traditions.",

In the first unit we will study the structure of consequentialist ethical views. We will read the work of old dead masters and exciting new theorists. In the second unit we address questions arising from collective action, such as the following: do you have any reason to vote, or recycle, or protest, if your actions by themselves are guaranteed not to make much difference? We will address a related dispute in the philosophy of activism. The third unit addresses the relationship between actions and character. We&iquest;ll address questions such as the following: what&iquest;s so great about abandoning one&iquest;s friends and family to attend to the greater good? Is it a problem if the best moral theory tells us not to follow it? By the end of all this, you will improve your understanding of ethics generally, as well as applications of related principles in economics, political theory, and public policy.",

But first, we'll examine whether meaningfulness is a subjective or objective affair. Our readings will primarily be in philosophy. But writers of literature often explore the question of meaningfulness in life, and some philosophers argue that telling our own stories is key to living a meaningful life.

The importance of the imagination in philosophy is contested: can it really help us understand what is possible and what's not, and if so, how? The role of the imagination in literature is undeniable, but often surprising in its details: why do we have real emotions in response to fictional stories? why do we seek out the negative emotions associated with tragedy and horror stories? Through guided discussion, live debate, close reading (of both philosophy and literature), and extensive writing, we will gain some insight into the fundamental faculty of thought that is the imagination.

        "description": "Grads enroll in 204. In this course, we shall examine some basic issues in metaethics in the context of Plato's and Aristotle's philosophy. First-order ethics asks questions such as 'What makes an action right?',  'What are virtues and vices?', 'Do I have, ceteris paribus, a duty to obey the laws?', and 'What is the best theory of social justice?'. Metaethics takes moral or ethical judgments as its subject matter and inquires into their nature. Basic metaethical questions include: 'What do moral or ethical judgments mean?'. When we say 'X is right', do we mean that X is objectively right?', 'Do moral judgments make claims about the world or about how we think about the world?' (These are questions about moral semantics.) Moral judgments, as we'll see, seem to involve the notion of evaluating actions, agents, social practices and so on. They are, in a bit of jargon, normative or evaluative. We'll try to get clearer on what such normativity involves by considering two other fundamental sort of metaethical questions. The first concerns the possibility of moral knowledge, includes questions such as 'Can we ever know if a moral claim is true and, if so, how can we know this?', 'In mathematics, chemistry, the history of India, and chess, for example, we think that there are experts who know more than we do and that we should, at least to some extent, defer to their judgments in their areas of expertise. Can there be moral experts to whom we should defer in the same way?' (These are questions about moral epistemology.) Yet other metaethical questions concern the place of morality in the world. Such questions include 'Are moral properties such rightness and wrongness &quot;out there&quot; in the world as we might think mass and electrical charge are (or being a neuron)?', 'Or are moral properties really just properties of our attitudes and beliefs?', 'Or do they simply not exist in the way that there is nothing that is phlogiston or Santa?' (Sorry). We'll start by reading some basic literature in contemporary metaethics and then turn to take up these questions in the context of Plato and Aristotle. By reading our ancient authors carefully, we'll try to work out the differences and similarities between their questions and answers and our own. I'm organizing the course so that both students who've done a good deal of work in metaethics and ancient philosophy and those who have done none at all will both be able to learn from the readings, the lectures, and what I hope will be lively classroom discussions.",

This work, from Plato's late period, with its highly notable postulations of the Demiurge and the receptacle, received the place of prominence in the ancient reception of Plato and contains a number of challenges in interpretation for contemporary scholars of Plato. We will carefully examine the work and its contributions to Platonic metaphysics, physics, psychology, teleology, cosmology, and theology. In so doing, we will also consider questions of how we are to understand it as a likely story, its role within the Platonic corpus, and its engagement with pre-existing traditions of Greek natural philosophy.",

In this class, we will learn the concepts and methods unique to phenomenology, and we will read the works of its major thinkers, including Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.

The result was a new concept of experience that is essentially embodied.

In this class, we will read one of Husserl's major later works, Cartesian Meditations, as well as companion essays from both his time and ours.

How does our concept of the animal shape our concept of the human being?  In this course, we will try to answer these questions by exploring the work of thinkers who have made major contributions to how we understand nonhuman animals including Aristotle, Darwin, Heidegger, Uexk&uuml;ll, Merleau-Ponty, Derrida, Deleuze and Guattari.

After introducing general ideas of induction and recursion, we will study a bit of elementary (axiomatic) set theory before then covering basic definability theory, viz. assessing the theoretical limits of what can and cannot be expressed in a first-order language. The centerpiece result of the class is the completeness - and closely related compactness - of first-order logic, a result with a number of momentous consequences, some useful, some philosophically puzzling. We will then study a connection with game theory, whereby a certain type of game characterizes precisely the expressive power of first-order logic. Further topics may include: the 0-1 law in finite model theory, second-order logic, and the algebraic approach to logic. Prerequisite: 150 or consent of instructor.",

As we will see, the subject is closely tied to the foundations of computation and computability. We will therefore spend the first half of the quarter establishing a solid framework for theorizing about the scope and limits of what can, in principle, be computed. We then turn to arithmetic as a canonical case study, working up to the famous incompleteness theorems of K. G&ouml;del. Finally, at the end we will discuss the philosophical repercussions of these results, centering the discussion around a dilemma known as G&ouml;del's disjunction: roughly, either the human mind is somehow non-algorithmic, or there must be mathematical truths that are, in a very strong sense, essentially beyond our ability to ascertain or prove.Prerequisite: 151/251.",

        "description": "Our intuitions about the nature of organisms and of individuals are challenged by numerous puzzle cases in recent biological science. The nature of individuals is of long-standing interest in philosophy (as well as in different branches of the sciences). However, ideas of biological individuality have been challenged by developments in a variety of subfields of biology, and related areas including, for example, evolutionary biology, developmental biology, microbiology, and immunology. These challenges invite us to present a traditional philosophical thread discussion with new and exciting puzzles. In this course, we will read and discuss papers and book excerpts from both historical and contemporary authors working on biological individuality, which is often spearheaded by the use of case studies. The course will begin with a select history of how the particular problem(s) of biological individuality developed. Having established a shared understanding of the range of questions and perspectives available, students will gain a common language to communicate about this topic with those working in other fields. A background in biology is not necessary to take this course, and we will only visit traditional philosophical conceptions of individuality insofar as they are illuminating for the cases and readings we cover. Students are welcome from the humanities and sciences alike with the opportunity to come together over a philosophical topic that has consequences both within philosophy and beyond.",

        "description": "Hobbes marks the beginning of a period of intensive discussion and debate among moral philosophers writing (mainly) in English. His successors argue about questions that are still among the primary questions in ethical theory: n1. The nature of moral judgments: metaphysical questions. nWhen we say, and sometimes claim to know, that an action is right, or a person is good, what sort of judgment is this? We often say they are true or false, but are we entitled to say so? If they are true, what sort of fact about the objective world makes them true? If no fact about the objective world makes them true, then what makes them true? n2. Moral knowledge: epistemological questions. nIf we sometimes know that a moral judgment is true or false, how do we know? Can we rely on anything analogous to perception (a moral sense)? What is the role of reason in moral judgments?n3. The practical function of moral judgments. nMoral judgments are practical, in so far as we make them with the intention of guiding our own action, when we try to make our mind up about the right thing to do, or of guiding other people's action, when we offer advice or criticism. Moreover, they engage our feelings, emotions, affections, and sentiments, not simply our rational capacities. What difference should this function of moral judgments make to our answers to the previous two questions? n4. The content of morality: normative questions. n(1) Can we derive the whole content of morality from enlightened self-interest? Are the principles underlying rational prudence the only ones we need if we are to understand morality? n(2) Can we derive morality from benevolence, understanding moral principles as simply the product of this sentiment? (3) Can we take moral principles to be various ways of promoting utility - the maximum happiness of all those affected by an action? n5. The justification of morality. nWhy should we care about morality? We might appeal to (1) self-interest; (2) sentiments, especially sympathy; (3) rational principles. nWe will discuss (1) The modification and elaboration of Hobbes's account of morality by Hume. n(2) The alternative to Hobbes that is developed by Butler, Price, and Reid. n(3) Kant's response to this debate among his predecessors.n(4) Sidgwick's attempt to reconcile elements of these different views.nThis course begins on January 28, and ends on March 13. May be repeated for credit.  2 unit option available only to PhD students beyond the second year.  Undergraduates wishing to take this course must have taken a previous Philosophy course and have the permission of the instructor.",

To be dominated, according to republican political philosophy, is to be subject to the arbitrary or uncontrolled power of another. And to be free is the absence of domination. This view was the dominant political conception of freedom in the western political tradition until the rise of classical liberalism in the 19th century. In this course, we will examine different accounts of domination and freedom in the republican political tradition and critiques of non-domination as a political conception of freedom. We will also examine the contemporary revival of the republican view and its application to social relations ranging from the workplace to the family and beyond (prerequisite: PHIL 80).",

First, we will read about what is the relationship between biological sex and gender; what is the relationship between gender and other forms of identity, e.g., race, class, sexual orientation, etc.; what issues arise when we consider our standard conceptions of knowledge, scientific inquiry, and rationality from the standpoint of oppression as women (any other gender identity). In the second part of the course, we will read about what constitutes oppression, how does it arise, and why women became oppressed; how our ethical and political theories should change to reflect feminist concerns about the status of women in modern society not limiting the latter to only feminist concerns and movements in affluent countries. We will read about feminist movements in Latina America, indigenous feminist movements, and India.",

Additionally, thousands of times a day, you manage to gain information about all manner of subjects by hearing strange sounds that have no natural connection to the subject matter. The sounds aren't like the bark of a dog, for example. You also manage to think about things that aren't in front of you, as when you think of a Hippo wearing a fedora. Yet activity in your brain has no natural connection to Hippos in fedoras (we presume). This class will investigate how it is that sounds, marks, and mental states manage to have semantic content.  In other words, we will discuss attempts to solve the mystery of meaning, in all of its forms.nThe class is open to all graduate students in philosophy.

The course explores varieties of testimonial knowledge which arise from relaxed everyday testimony ('the coffee machine is broken') and from scientific expert testimony ('Venus is larger than Mars'). The course also touches on issues concerning testimonial injustice - the type of injustice that occurs when someone is wronged in their capacity as a testifier - for example, when their testimony is unjustly devaluated. Finally, we will consider whether philosophical theorizing about testimony may shed light on obstacles for science communication about divisive issues such as vaccines, climate science etc.nnThus, the course is organized around three interrelated themes. 1: Foundational questions, 2: Testimonial injustice and 3: Scientific testimony. Overall, then, the course connects foundational work in epistemology and philosophy of science to some pertinent ethical and political problems.",

On the other hand, if it is not true, then since it says it is not true, what it says is the case. So if the sentence is true it is not true, and if it is not true it is true. This is a version of the Liar Paradox. In this class we'll discuss the liar and other paradoxes, including the paradoxes of set theory, the Sorites Paradox, and several other well-known paradoxes.

When does a machine become a person? What do we owe to other people?  Is there always a right way to act? How can we live in a highly imperfect world? And what can film do that other media can't? We'll think about all of these great questions with the help of films that are philosophically stimulating, stylistically intriguing, and, for the most part, gripping to watch: Do The Right Thing (Lee), The Dark Knight (Nolan), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Kaufman), Arrival (Villeneuve), My Dinner with Andr&eacute; (Malle), Blade Runner (Scott), La Jet&eacute;e (Marker), Fight Club (Fincher), No Country for Old Men (Coen), The Seventh Seal (Bergman), and Memento (Nolan).

It was only recovered in the 19th century and only in the past 15 years or so do we have a reliable text.  Thus studies of it are very much underdeveloped.  We shall also read as background some other protreptic works by Plato and the rhetorician Isocrates. 2 unit option is only for Philosophy PhD students beyond the second year.",

It is also heterogenous or interdisciplinary in its discussions, which will lead us to consider questions of method in Aristotle.

It introduces students to a wide range of topics at the intersection of philosophy with literary and arts criticism. The seminar is intended for graduate students. It is suitable for theoretically ambitious students of literature and the arts, philosophers with interests in value theory, aesthetics, and topics in language and mind, and other students with strong interest in the psychological importance of engagement with the arts. In this year's installment, we will focus on issues about the nature of fiction, about the experience of appreciation and what it does for us, about the ethical consequences of imaginative fictions, and about different conceptions of the importance of the arts in life more broadly.

In this graduate seminar, we will study the science and engineering of explanations, combining perspectives from philosophy, psychology, AI, and the legal sciences. We will ask questions like: When do we ask for explanations? What makes a good explanation? How can we build machines that can understand and explain? This interdisciplinary seminar is co-taught by Thomas Icard (Philosophy) and Tobias Gerstenberg (Psychology). We will meet twice a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays 10:30am-11:50am) to discuss research articles from a range of disciplines. Students are expected to write responses based on their readings, lead the discussion on one of the papers, and actively participate in the discussion otherwise. As a final project, students will outline a novel study on explanation that makes an empirical, modeling, or theoretical contribution. Participation is restricted to a maximum of 12 graduate students (by application). The course website, with information about application, can be found here: phil350.stanford.edu",

The work of Kurt G&ouml;del (1940) and Paul Cohen (1963) demonstrate that CH is neither provable nor refutable from the standard axioms of set theory (ZFC). This independence result has significant implications in mathematics, logic, and philosophy.  Following a nutshell overview of background material in logic and set theory (including G&ouml;del's Completeness and Incompleteness Theorems, Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, Axiom of Choice, ordinal and cardinal number systems), this course explores independence results in set theory in general, as well as some of the key methods for proving them. Topics include G&ouml;del's model L for ZF with CH, and Cohen's method of forcing for a model of ZF with the negation of CH.  Time permitting, additional topics may include independence results associated with large cardinal axioms, existence of measurable sets, and axioms of determinacy. 2 unit option is only for Philosophy PhD students beyond the second year.",

It describes the philosophical assumptions that form the basis of social inquiry and its practices, and it criticizes them to secure their ability to explain and/or predict social phenomena. This seminar will focus, primarily, on social scientific methodology. The main goal of the seminar is to clarify our answers to the question: should social scientific methodology be different from the methodology employed in the &iquest;hard&iquest; sciences? To answer this question, first, we will focus on economic methodology. We will assess topics such as: the epistemic virtues of economic models, whether macroeconomic models need microfoundations, ceteris paribus clauses, randomized control trials, etc. For the second part of the seminar, we will focus on the epistemic value of ethnographic research methods in Anthropology, which is fundamentally different from any method used in the natural (hard) sciences. Although the use of ethnographies has become more popular in the last decades, philosophers of science have failed to focus on their epistemic import. Because of this, we will ponder on questions such as: what type of knowledge is produced by ethnographies? Is this knowledge scientific enough? If not, what is lacking? If yes, should ethnographies be used in other scientific domains?",

        "description": "Is the Earth's climate real? Does it exist beyond experimental data, computer simulation, and scientists' writings? This seminar considers philosophical, historical, and anthropological perspectives on the reality of scientific entities. It asks how these metaphysical questions are connected to our democratic societies and our position as scholars. We will ask whether Homo sapiens is sub-divided into races and ethnicities in the manner of a census form. And how genetics should interact with our social understanding of human diversity. Further, can the answers to these questions stand alone as isolated academic questions, or must they be tied together with our political philosophy and social norms? If democratic pluralism leads to metaphysical pluralism, what becomes of long-discarded scientific entities, such as phlogiston? Some argue that pluralism upsets our most basic scientific facts, like: water is H2O. nnThis graduate seminar examines these scientific entities - the climate, races, phlogiston - from perspectives in Philosophy, Anthropology, and History of Science. The course topics illustrate recent trends toward metaphysics in the humanistic study of science. Students will develop their ability to compare positions and arguments between disciplines. Class time will emphasize inter-disciplinary discussion. The major writing assignment is an essay with multiple drafts. This is designed to prepare students for writing and revising dissertation chapters and peer-reviewed articles. Activities may include a film screening and visit to a scientific laboratory. Students from all programs are welcome. (Advanced undergraduates by permission.)",

For example, they want their work to be deep, explanatory, fitting or even beautiful.  This simple observation from mathematical practice raises philosophical questions: What do these terms mean?  Why is work that exhibits these properties valuable?  Are there design principles we can follow to help ensure our mathematics has these qualities?  Throughout this course we will explore these questions by seeing what mathematicians and philosophers have had to say and by examining both modern and historical case studies.",

Some philosophers respond, explicitly or implicitly, to such criticisms by arguing that philosophy can be, or at least their philosophical methodology and theories are, closely allied to the scientific method or to scientific results. They often call themselves naturalists, physicalists, or materialists. Their opponents argue, for at least some domains, that attempts to do philosophy in this vein fail. Such opponents are sometimes labelled non-naturalists. We will attempt to make sense of the various methodological and substantive issues supposedly at stake in these debates and consider the arguments for and against various competing approaches to these matters.

After an introduction to the period in which &iquest;deliberative democracy&iquest; was the most influential paradigm, we will look closely at developments beginning with the &iquest;epistemic&iquest; variant of that approach (Estlund, Landemore), an ensuing reaction on epistemic grounds against democracy (Brennan, Mulligan), and then two new approaches that are influential: the case for (and against) choosing &iquest;representatives&iquest; by lottery rather than voting (Guerrero, Saunders), and the idea that the model for democratic equality is nothing like majoritarianism or agents who act on behalf of constituents but the idea of a social and institutional world in which no class or category of citizens is generally above the others, increasingly called &iquest;relational equality&iquest; (Pettit, Anderson, Scheffler, Kolodny).",

        "description": "Adam Smith and Karl Marx share a broad view of the role of markets in society. Rather than view markets narrowly as simply mechanisms for efficient distribution, both saw a role for markets in shaping culture, politics and political conflict, and society - and vice versa. However, Marx and Smith differ in their overall assessment of the value of the market as an institution for promoting liberty and equality. Indeed, their perspectives, while overlapping in some respects, are distinctive in ways that resonate with debates in contemporary philosophy and political economy over the characteristics of a just society, sources of development (political and economic), and theories of change. This course explores Smith's and Marx's views of markets, property, liberty and equality, in the context of major societal transformations that took place in the nineteenth century, such as the Industrial Revolution, the emergence of modern democracy, Dickensian England, the role of institutions, and the rise of monopoly power.",

Solidarity is a property of collaborations involving mutual concern and recognition. We will study four topics, corresponding to the four weeks of the course. First, contemporary views on solidarity, including work by Tommie Shelby, Mike Zhao, Avery Kolers, and Sally Scholz. Second, we will explore some continuities with work in collective action and group responsibility, in particular from Stephanie Collins and Garrett Cullity. Third, we will consider some continuities and contrasts with work on relational equality and economic democracy. Here we will likely read Samuel Scheffler, Elizabeth Anderson, and Carole Pateman. We may also enter into the debate between Axel Honneth and Nancy Fraser on recognition and distribution. Finally, we will consider some implications for the ethics of institutional design, engaging with some joint work of mine developing a new workforce model for pharmaceutical care in Scotland and some related work on 'industrial epistemology'.",

Our subject is thus a set of philosophical concepts, particularly legal positivism and natural law, but the approach is not purely conceptual. Rather, we will examine both the philosophical concepts in the abstract and how those philosophical concepts are reflected or actualized in the craft of legal argumentation, in the intellectual history of law, and in contemporary questions of politics and government. Above all, we will ask which conception of law best contributes to legal justice. The course consists in three units. Unit I is about theories of the nature of law, focusing on legal positivism and natural law. Unit II is about theories of particular departments of law, focusing on tort law and criminal law. Unit III takes a philosophical perspective on being a lawyer, focusing on questions of what principles define lawyers' role in society and what ideals give the life of a lawyer meaning. Grading is based on class participation, two in-class moot court presentations, and, based on individual student preference, either a final exam (a one-day take-home essay with a word limit) or a final research paper.

        "description": "This course examines the theoretical foundations of criminal procedure- political, historical, and, above all, philosophical. What are the ideas at work in the American system of criminal procedure? How, historically, did the system develop, and why does it presently function as it does? Is the system broken and, if so, what principles should orient us in fixing it? This theoretical inquiry has a practical point. Procedure plays a major role in the present crisis of American criminal justice. By examining criminal procedure's theoretical foundations, this course aims to develop competing &quot;big picture,&quot; synthetic perspectives on the criminal justice crisis as a whole. Thus, for students interested in criminal justice reform, this course will equip you to take a philosophically richer view of the underlying policy issues. For students thinking about a career in criminal law, this course will equip you to engage in large-scale thinking about how criminal procedure should change, rather than just working within the doctrinal and institutional structures that exist at present. For students interested in legal academia, this course will develop your ability to read sophisticated theoretical material, to write in the same vein, and to relate theoretical ideas to policy prescriptions.  Elements used in grading: Class participation and, based on individual student preference, either a final reflection paper (2 units) or a final research paper with instructor permission.  Students electing the final research paper option can take the course for either 2 or 3 units, depending on paper length.  Cross-listed with the Law School (LAW 2019).",

        "description": "Our human lives involve remarkable forms of practical organization: diachronic organization of individual intentional activity; small-scale social organization of shared intentional action; and the organization of complex, organized institutions. A philosophically illuminating theory of human action should help us understand these multiple forms of human practical organization and their inter-relations. This graduate seminar primarily focuses on the role of shared intention and shared agency in organized institutions. The main focus will be a book manuscript on which I am working: Shared and Institutional Agency: Toward a Planning Theory of Human Practical Organization. In this book I seek to extend the foundational role of our capacity for planning agency first to shared agency and then thereby to human organized institutions. To do this I draw on the idea from H.L.A. Hart that our organized institutions are rule-governed, and that to understand this we need a theory of social rules. We will work through this manuscript, together with a wide range of related work by others, including work by H.L.A. Hart, Margaret Gilbert, Scott Shapiro, Philip Pettit, John Searle, Geoffrey Brennan, Cristina Bicchieri, Donald Davidson, and Harry Frankfurt.nnEnrollment limited to graduate students in Philosophy, others by permission of instructor.  2 unit option available only to Philosophy PhD students beyond the second year.",

These institutions yield standards by which individual conduct in pertinent contexts can be assessed; these standards can themselves be ethically evaluated. Individuals must organize their commitments to these standards and evaluations in some kind of ethically responsible way. These issues have been discussed on rather different terms in normative ethics, political theory, normative theory, action theory, and social metaphysics. Our goal will be to bring these different literatures to bear on a general inquiry into the ethics of institutional participation. Topics may include: recent work on reasoning; rule worship; exclusionary and silencing reasons; the putative distinctness of political normativity; incentives and the 'ethos of justice'; the ethics of exchange; social structures and practices; and institutionalised relational values. nnLimited to graduate students in Philosophy and to others by permission of the instructor. 2 unit option available only to PhD students beyond the second year.",

        "description": "Over the past three decades, a relational egalitarian conception of equality has emerged in political philosophy. Proponents of the view argue that the point of equality is to establish communities whose members are able to stand and relate as equals. This entails building societies free from a variety of modes of relating that are thought to be detrimental to our status as moral equals. The list of those inegalitarian relationships is long: oppression, domination, exploitation, marginalization, objectification, demonization, infantilization, stigmatization, etc. The graduate seminar will introduce students to the rich literature on equality in contemporary political philosophy, with a special focus on identifying and scrutinizing unequal relationships. Each week will be centered on a specific unequal relationship, trying to understand how it operates, what social function it serves, and what makes it specifically harmful or wrongful to groups and individuals. Advanced undergraduate students will be considered and should email the PI to communicate their interest. 2 unit option only for Phil PhDs beyond the second year.",
