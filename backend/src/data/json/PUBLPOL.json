There is an increasingly contentious debate about the proper role of the government and regarding the impact of specific government policies.  This debate is rarely grounded in a common set of facts. In this seminar, we will explore how each level of government interacts with U.S. residents through government services, public programs, taxes, and regulations. We will examine financial results for different levels of government while considering the net effects of government intervention on the health and economic well-being of individuals and families. Particular attention will be paid to certain sectors (e.g. education, health care, etc.) and to certain groups (e.g. those in poverty, the elderly, etc.). Along the way we will accumulate a set of metrics to assess the performance of each level of government while highlighting the formidable challenges of such an exercise. Prerequisite: Econ 1.",

This course will provide an introduction to local government, focusing initially on the purpose, functions, and structure of local government through a weekly speaker series featuring experts and officials in local government. The second half of the course will focus on specific policy areas such as environment, social justice, and affordable housing, where speakers involved with the local government initiatives explored in each unit will discuss their experiences with the class. Students will also have the opportunity to simulate a City Council meeting and learn how they can get involved in their local government. This course is the first part in a project-based learning series running through Winter and Spring Quarters. Students who take this class can apply for a position on a team working on a predetermined project for local governments around the Bay Area during Spring Quarter. Students accepted into the project-based learning experience will attend weekly training sessions during the second half of Winter Quarter in addition to normal class sessions to prepare for their projects.  You can enroll in the Winter course without participating in the Spring class/project.To earn credit, students must attend at least 8 of the 10 meetings in the speaker series, complete the two assignments, and actively participate in the simulation. Students will be allowed up to two excused absences. (Cardinal Course certified by the Haas Center)",

We will explore personal finance issues such as taxes, loans, charity, insurance, and pensions. Using the context of (hypothetical) personal finance positions, we will discuss the public policy implications of various proposals and how they affect different groups of people, for example: the implications of differential tax rates for different types of income, the promotion of home ownership in the U.S., and policies to care for our aging population. While economic policy will be the focus of much of the course, we will also examine some of the implications of social policies on personal finance as well.

        "description": "How do I translate my interests and skills into a career in public service and social impact? This course will introduce you to a wide range of roles that help shape public policy and civic life, including government, education, nonprofits, social enterprises, and arts/media.  It can be taken for one or two units. For one unit, you participate in a weekly, interactive speaker series designed to give you a sense for what different public service careers are like. Each week, guests describe their organizations and roles, highlight key intellectual issues and policy challenges, discuss their career paths, and describe skills crucial for the job. For a second unit, you participate in a hands-on weekly session designed to help you translate this knowledge into action. You will identify roles and organizations that might be a good match for you, build your network through informational interviewing, receive career coaching, and acquire the tools you need to launch your job or internship search. This course is intended for all students and all majors. Course content will be relevant to students soon entering the job market as well as those facing choices about courses of study and internships. Class sessions will be 60 minutes. This course is co-sponsored by the Haas Center for Public Service, the School of Humanities and Sciences, and Stanford in Government. Students taking the course for one unit (Tuesday lecture) must enroll in the -01 course option, and students taking the course for two units (Tuesday lecture and Thursday seminar) must enroll in the -02 course option.

Admitted undergraduates will be mentored by a distinguished leader from the Air Force, Army, CIA, Coast Guard, FBI, Marine Corps, Navy, Space Force, or State Department for the Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters of the 2023-24 academic year. Participation in all three quarters is required. These military leaders, diplomats, and intelligence professionals are part of the Hoover Institution's National Security Affairs Fellows program. The scheduled class time will be used for group activities, lectures from the National Security Affairs Fellows on their experiences in the U.S. government, small group meetings with mentees and mentors, and special sessions with senior American foreign policy leaders. At the end of each quarter, students write short reflection papers. No expertise in international affairs is necessary to apply and all majors are welcome. Selection is based on academic excellence, extracurricular leadership, and interest in international affairs. The program is directed by Dr. Amy Zegart. To apply, send a cover letter and resume to hoovernsaf@stanford.edu by September 6, 2023.",

        "description": "American democracy faces a series of unprecedented challenges. This course will identify the greatest areas of weakness in the American political system, make sense of the most pressing threats facing democracy, and contemplate how democracy can be strengthened. With this them - in defense of democracy - in mind, we will examine several questions: What guiding principles, norms, and institutions organize and structure American politics, and how do they affect the health and effectiveness of American democracy? What do patterns of political participation and representation in the United States tell us about the health of our democracy? How do partisan and social identities breed hostility and antagonism among the mass public? How does information from the media and other sources advance or frustrate democratic outcomes? What does increased violence - political, racially motivated, or otherwise - reveal about the trajectory of democracy in the United States? This is a course built on the science of politics, and our aim is to bring the scientific study of politics to bear on these pressing questions.",

        "description": "Justice, as we use the term in this class, is a question about social cooperation. People can produce much more cooperatively than the sum of what they could produce as individuals, and these gains from cooperation are what makes civilization possible. But on what terms should we cooperate? How should we divide, as the philosopher John Rawls puts it, &quot;the benefits and burdens of social cooperation&quot;? Working primarily within the Anglo-American philosophical tradition, we'll discuss different answers to this big question as a way to bring together some of the most prominent debates in modern political philosophy. We'll study theories including utilitarianism, libertarianism, classical liberalism, and egalitarian liberalism, and we'll take on complex current issues like reparations for racial injustice, the gender pay gap, and responses to climate change. This class is meant to be an accessible entry point to political philosophy. No experience with political science or philosophy is required or assumed, and we will spend time on the strategy of philosophy as well: understanding how our authors make their arguments to better respond to them and make our own.",

Themes will include, among others: AI and policy considerations; social media and policy considerations; race and police brutality incidents; national security (including cyber threats); the Iran nuclear agreement; non-profit organizations in the policy and US landscape; and various corporate matters. Organizing themes include, among others: ethics of leadership; ethics of persuasion and compromise; influence of bias in organizational and policy ethics; ethics of social movements; discrepancies between discourse and action; emotion and ethics; and interpreting and explaining ethics. In addition, the course will offer training in a wide variety of skills for effective communication of ethics for policy purposes (developing succinct arguments, presentations, website discourse, commenting in meetings and conferences, interviews, statement of personal views, interacting with the media and social media, and mapping complex ethical analysis). Most of the assignments allow students flexibility to explore topics of their choice. The objective is to engage actively and improve skills in a supportive environment. A short, analytically rigorous final paper in lieu of final exam. Attendance required. Grading will be based on short assignments, class participation, and the short final paper. The course is open to undergraduate and graduate students. Undergraduates will not be at a disadvantage. Everyone will be challenged. Students wishing to take the course who are unable to sign up within the enrollment limit should contact Dr. Susan Liautaud at susanl1@stanford.edu. Distinguished Career Institute Fellows are welcome and should contact Dr. Susan Liautaud directly at susanl1@stanford.edu. This three-credit seminar accompanies  PUBLPOL 134 Ethics on the Edge but can also be taken as a stand-alone course. *Please note the course is being offered for two units and therefore is ineligible for Ways credit in the 2019-20 academic year. Please note that this course will require one make-up evening session on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday in April in lieu of the final class session the first week of June, so the course ends before Memorial Day.",

        "description": "This course will explore changing notions of truth in a world in which technology, global risks, and societal developments are blurring the boundaries of humanity and boring through traditional notions of nation states, institutions, and human identity. We will ask one over-arching question: does truth matter anymore? If so, why and how? If not, why not? Either way, how does truth relate to ethical decision-making by individuals and institutions and to an ethical society? How does truth relate to a life well lived? Six themes will organize our exploration of more specific topics: science and subjectivity; identity; memory; authenticity; religious truth; and truth and the law. Examples of topics to be explored include, among others: truth and technology (from deep fakes to home devices); white supremacy;  DNA testing and the 'identify as' movement, and identity; University history (Rhodes, Georgetown slavery, Yale Calhoun College...); the connections among truth, memory, and history; new questions in gender and racial identity; Chinese beautifying app Meitu and other social media &quot;truth modifiers&quot;; the sharing economy; the impact of AI and DNA testing sites on legal truth. Scotty McClennan will explore truth through major literary characters and the impact of religion on truth. We will consider how we determine and verify the truth; how we &quot;do&quot; truth; the role of truth in ethical decision-making; the importance of truth to effective ethical policy; and the relationship of the truth to a life well lived. An analytically rigorous short final paper in lieu of exam. This three-credit seminar may be taken as a stand-alone course or may accompany  PUBLPOL 134 Ethics on the Edge to full the Public Policy major ethics requirement.

Law, among its other benefits, can serve as a mechanism to harmonize private incentives with cooperative gains, to maintain an equitable division of those gains, and to deter social defection and dystopia. Law is thus an implementation of the social contract and essential to civilization. Economic analysis of law focuses on the welfare-enhancing incentive effects of law (and of law enforcement). More generally, we study the law's role in reducing the risks of cooperation, achieved by fixing expectations of what courts or the state will do in possible futures. Prerequisite: ECON 50. Final paper instead of an exam. Instructor consent required for enrollment. Please email the instructor a short statement of interest (300 words max) explaining why you would like to enroll in the course.",

        "description": "This course examines the past, present, and future of American espionage. Targeted at first years and sophomores, the class surveys key issues in the development of the U.S. Intelligence Community since World War II. Topics include covert action, intelligence successes and failures, the changing motives and methods of traitors, congressional oversight, and ethical dilemmas. The course pays particular attention to how emerging technologies are transforming intelligence today. We examine cyber threats, the growing use of AI for both insight and deception, and the 'open-source' intelligence revolution online. Classes include guest lectures by former senior U.S. intelligence officials, policymakers, and open-source intelligence leaders. Course requirements include an all-day crisis simulation with former senior officials designed to give students a hands-on feel for the uncertainties, coordination challenges, time pressures, and policy frictions of intelligence in the American foreign policy process.",

        "description": "(Formerly GEOLSCI 118Y and 218Y) The complex urban problems affecting quality of life in the Bay Area, from housing affordability and transportation congestion to economic vitality and social justice, are already perceived by many to be intractable, and will likely be exacerbated by climate change and other emerging environmental and technological forces. Reforming urban systems to improve the equity, resilience and sustainability of communities will require new collaborative methods of assessment, goal setting, and problem solving across governments, markets, and communities. It will also require academic institutions to develop new models of co-production of knowledge across research, education, and practice. This XYZ course series is designed to immerse students in co-production for social change. The course sequence covers scientific research and ethical reasoning, skillsets in data-driven and qualitative analysis, and practical experience working with local partners on urban challenges that can empower students to drive responsible systems change in their future careers. The Autumn (X) and Winter (Y) courses are focused on basic and advanced skills, respectively, and completion is a prerequisite for participation in the Spring (Z) practicum quarter, which engages teams in real-world projects with Bay Area local governments or community groups. X and Y are composed of four weekly pedagogical components: (A) lectures; (B) writing prompts linked with small group discussion; (C) lab and self-guided tutorials on the R programming language; and (D) R data analysis assignments.

        "description": "This course seeks to prepare future policymakers and industry leaders for the complex debate surrounding the development and employment of automated and autonomous weapons for warfare. Exploring the developmental, legal, ethical, and operational considerations of introducing automated and autonomous systems into warfare, the course will seek to create a broad understanding of strategic opportunities and risk. The course will begin by examining the principles and functions of war to provide a baseline of why warfighters pursue automation and autonomy, and we will examine historical examples of how militaries have integrated these concepts in a variety of contexts. The course will then examine the relevant technologies - both those immediately available and those that push the future technological frontier. Those include computers, robotics, and artificial intelligence as well as the processes for turning technology into warfighting capability. In the final phase we will review applicable legal and policy regimes, and consider the ethical dilemmas created by the introduction of new automated and autonomous capability from military, governmental, commercial, and activist perspectives. A secondary objective of the course is to prepare students with a practical policymaking toolkit for analyzing and developing policy for a complex issue, with applicability beyond the issue of autonomy and warfare. This course encourages students to digest the information about autonomy and warfare, and to think creatively and practically about how policymakers and private sector leaders should address them, through a series of simulations, briefings and written exercises, and exercises intended to represent the actual policymaking progress. This course does not advocate any policy position but instead seeks to foster a more complete understanding of why and how automated and autonomous systems are being integrated into warfare as well as a circumspect review of the advantages, risks, and opportunities. This is a seminar course with limited enrollment. Each class session will be divided into lecture/discussion format where each lecture will set the stage for a vigorous guided discussion. Students will be required to explore policy options and debate the advantages and risk inherent in each option. The course will also leverage industry, technology, policy, and operational experts to provide differing viewpoints and specialized knowledge and experience.",

Topics covered include the construction of political identity among Asian, Black, Latino, Native, and White Americans; the politics of immigration and acculturation; and the influence of racial identity on public opinion, voting behavior, the media, social movements, and in the justice system. We will tackle questions such as: What makes a political campaign ad 'racist?' Why did Donald Trump's support among Black, Latino, and Asian voters increase from 2016 to 2020? Are undocumented immigrants really more likely to commit crimes than U.S. citizens? How can we measure whether there is racial bias in policing? What do we even mean when we use the terms 'race' and 'ethnicity' - and how have the definitions of identity groups evolved over time? Throughout, students will be pushed to carefully evaluate data-based claims, critically analyze their own assumptions, and bring to bear empirical evidence to support their arguments in an inclusive learning environment. Prior coursework in Statistics or Economics strongly recommended.",

        "description": "Cities and urban areas have always been transformed by major external changes like pandemics and public health crises. California is both in the midst of its greatest economic recession since the Great Depression and experiencing a pandemic that has the potential to reshape many aspects of life. Planning for cities and regions, however, is a long game that requires follow-through on decisions made sometimes over many decades. How do we balance the shocks to our assumptions from the current Covid world with the need to plan long-term for issues like affordable housing and equitable cities, and perhaps most fundamentally, prepare our cities and communities for the inevitability of climate change and climate impact? nnnnThis course takes an interdisciplinary view of the key contemporary planning topics in California. It does so from looking at the intersection of climate laws, land use changes, the need for housing, travel patterns and the availability of high quality jobs and employment. This course will give you an understanding of the roles of key levels of government, from the state to the region/metropolitan scale, to the city and county, down to the neighborhood and parcel level. it will give students insight into leading themes and issues of the day in California such as the future of downtowns, the role of high speed rail, the impact of telework, automation in the construction of housing, drawing from examples in San Jose and San Francisco, the Central Valley, the state legislature, Southern California. Within each of these topics we will look at the impact of decisions on equity as well as climate and the economy. nnnnThe instructors are Kristy Wang, formerly SPUR&iquest;s Community Planning Policy Director, and Egon Terplan, Senior Advisor for Economic Development and Transportation in the California Governor&iquest;s Office, formerly SPUR&iquest;s Regional Planning Director.

        "description": "The last decade has seen dramatic developments and a rekindling of interest in space efforts.  Silicon Valley has invested in a range of activities, including reusable launch services, constellations of communication and observation satellites, off-planet resource development, and even space tourism.  Governments are restructuring their space-oriented military and regulatory agencies.  Scientific missions continue to benefit from advances in technology, extending the reach and capabilities of robotic missions.  Human missions will finally revisit deep space after decades spent solely in low earth orbit. nnThis course investigates the economic, policy, and engineering challenges to building a thriving private and public space industry.  We begin with a review of historical space efforts, both public and private.  We will investigate current efforts in detail, including budgeting, regulatory frameworks, and the key drivers of the renewed space activity.  Externalities provide a core rationale for governmental policy action, including such topics as conflicts over spectrum used by space assets, stimulating innovation, orbital debris challenges, dual-use space technologies, and unclear or conflicting rights to develop space-based resources.  Leaders from government and new space companies will occasionally participate in the class.nnStudents will be expected to participate in policy and case discussions, contribute several papers including a final project paper, and complete problem and policy analyses.  Readings will include articles, policy papers, HBS cases, regulatory filings, and mission reviews.",

        "description": "(PUBLPOL 134, PUBLPOL 234 - 3 credits; Ways - ER; Same as LAW 7020) The objective of this course is to explore the increasing ethical challenges in a world in which technology, global risks, and societal developments are accelerating faster than our understanding and the law can keep pace. We will unravel the factors contributing to the seemingly pervasive failure of ethics today among organizations and leaders across all sectors: business, government, non-profit, and academia. A framework for ethical decision-making underpins the course. There is significant space for personal reflection and forming your own views on a wide range of issues. Prominent guest speakers will attend certain sessions interactively. The relationships among ethics and technology, culture, leadership, law, and global risks (inequality, privacy, financial system meltdown, cyber-terrorism, climate change, etc.) will inform discussion. A broad range of international topics might include: designer genetics; civilian space travel (Elon Musk's Mars plans); social media (Facebook Cambridge Analytica, on-line sex trafficking, monopolies); new devices (e.g. Amazon Alexa in hotel rooms); free speech on University campuses; opioid addiction; AI (from racism to the work challenge and beyond); corporate and financial sector scandals (Theranos, Wells Fargo fraudulent account creation, Volkswagen emissions testing manipulation); new corporate challenges (Google selling drones to the military and Facebook's new Libra crypto currency); and non-profit sector ethics challenges (NGOs engagement with ISIS and sexual misconduct in humanitarian aid [Oxfam case]). Final project in lieu of exam on a topic of student's choice.  Attendance required. Class participation important, with multiple opportunities to earn participation credit beyond speaking in class. Strong emphasis on rigorous analysis, critical thinking and testing ideas in real-world contexts.  Note that this course will require one make-up evening session on a Wednesday or Thursday in early May in lieu of the final class session on June 5. Permission numbers are required for enrollment and will be granted via application at https://forms.gle/56M29nzXE51cHSFX6. Applications will be accepted March 1-9. The course offers credit toward Public Policy core requirements (if taken in combination with PUBLPOL 103F) and Science, Technology, and Society majors, and it satisfies the undergraduate Ways of Thinking - ER requirement. The course is open to undergraduate and graduate students. Undergraduates will not be at a disadvantage. Everyone will be challenged. Students taking the course for Ways credit and Public Policy majors taking the course to complete the core requirements must obtain a letter grade. Others may take the course for a letter grade or C/NC. Students seeking credit for other majors should consult their departments.",

The premise of the course is that, as important and valuable as surveys are, it's a capital mistake to presume that we know what needs to be asked and that fixed-response answers adequately convey the depth of what's happening. We introduce a new type of qualitative method that allows for discovery by capturing the voices of the people, learn what they're thinking and fearing, and understand the decisions they're making. Students are trained in immersive interviewing by completing actual interviews, coding and analyzing their field notes, and then writing reports describing what's happening across the country. These reports will be designed to find out who's hurting, why they're hurting, and how we can better respond to the crisis.

This product may then be built in a follow-up Using Tech for Good (Computer Science 50) class in the first quarter of 2018 (but class participants are not required to take that follow-up class). The course is premised on the view that innovative solutions to poverty will be based on new conversations and an authentic collaboration between Silicon Valley and leaders from education, government, and low-income communities",

Given daunting societal challenges like climate change, inequality, and racial injustice, what objectives should corporations have?  In this course, we discuss the ongoing debate about the social responsibility of corporations. We consider shareholder activism, divestments made by university endowments and other ways investors might influence corporations. We look at the ESG (environment, social, governance) movement and the potential for &quot;impact investing&quot; to solve problems. Throughout we focus on whether the incentives of key decision makers are aligned with desirable objectives. We will bring to class CEOs and leading investors in public and private equity, to ensure we provide a balance of theory and practice.",

        "description": "This Writing in the Major (WIM) course for Public Policy will focus on students being able to identify innovative solutions to address the energy, environmental, and infrastructure challenges in North America and clearly communicate these strategies for problem solving and/or regional green growth strategy development. Students will learn how to write policy analysis memos, presentations, and reports for decision makers in the public sector while also being able to identify and assess economic development and/or business opportunities to advance sustainability and low carbon development at the regional level. Clean Innovation through technological, business, policy and social innovation is needed to produce the goods and services that will enable a carbon neutral future in the region. This transformative process, along with the innovation cycles of the energy, water, urban, transport and digital sectors, is full of business opportunities. Efforts to advance smarter, cleaner, inclusive and more prosperous communities in North America presents a great opportunity for innovation, entrepreneurship and well-integrated planning for low-carbon economic development in the region. Our course will aim to utilize the Stanford Silicon Valley ingenuity, combined with California's policy experience and leadership in advancing climate and sustainability locally and at the global level as a source of inspiration to articulate pertinent and pragmatic solutions in order to address longstanding and emerging cross-country energy and environment policy issues in the region. It will also analyze the challenges that electoral political cycles and the constant evolution of the institutional context for energy and environmental cooperation present among the three members of the United States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement (USMCA). In addition, this course will satisfy the Writing in the Major (WIM) requirement for Public Policy. As such, this course focuses on policy writing short memos, PowerPoint and a policy report. By the end of the course, students should be able to craft a concise 1-2 page memo that conveys policy analysis (possibly including graphs/tables or other data) to support its recommendations and central arguments. In addition, they will learn to work with team members on a short policy or implementation strategy paper from an interdisciplinary perspective as is typically done in policy arenas.",

        "description": "In our cities, we find the greatest concentrations of the world's great problems - poverty, homelessness, violent crime, and GHG emissions, to name a few.  So too, cities present many of the most innovative, impactful solutions to these challenges.  In this seminar, we'll look at three great challenges that confront Americans - the dearth of affordable housing, the growing impacts of climate change, and violent crime - in the urban context.  We'll explore the legal, fiscal, and political limitations that constrain the terrain of local policymaking, and we will assess best practices among cities for enacting meaningful change within that landscape.  Readings and discussion will overwhelmingly focus on U.S. cities, but we will consider a few examples from abroad as well.  We will seek to move beyond familiar ideological battles to emphasize outcomes, evidence-based solutions, and analytical rigor.  From contemporary academic studies and journals, news articles, case law, and guest speakers, students will gain an appreciation for cities as policy laboratories for pragmatic solutions that often elude binary labelling as &quot;progressive&quot; or &quot;conservative.&quot;  Students will be better prepared to understand and engage in cities as civic leaders, legal advisors or adversaries, participants in economic transactions, and constituents.  This class is limited to 25 students, with an effort made to have students from SLS (15 by lottery) and 10 non-law students by consent of the instructor.

Students will collaborate in interdisciplinary teams on a problem with a partner organization. Along with the guidance of faculty mentors and the teaching staff, students will engage in a project with outcomes ranging from policy memos and white papers to data visualizations and software. Possible projects suggested by partner organizations will be presented at an information session in early March.  Following the infosession, a course application will open for teams to be selected before the start of Spring Quarter. Students may apply to a project with a partner organization or with a preformed team and their own idea to be reviewed for approval by the course staff.  There will be one meeting per week for the full class and at least one weekly meeting with the project-based team mentors.  Prerequisites: Appropriate preparation depends on the nature of the project proposed, and will be verified by the teaching staff based on your application.",

        "description": "In virtually every major U.S. city, the lack of affordable housing or homelessness (or both) constitutes the most urgent concern to residents. Amid ample hang-wringing by politicians, pundits, and the press, the human toll of the housing affordability crises has only worsened.  This class will focus on solutions to this crisis. Solutions abound, but implementing them at scale requires understanding--and navigating--the legal, economic, and political constraints faced by decision makers. It's in large cities where we see the problem most acutely, but where we also see America's most innovative solutions. So, this class--taught by the former mayor of one of America's dozen largest cities-- will have a decidedly urban focus. While the local entitlement and development process will provide a starting point, the class will also delve into key elements of state and federal policy and law that shape the local responses to these crises. An eclectic set of sources --studies, court opinions, consultant reports, economic meta-analyses, news accounts and an occasional guest lecturer--will support class discussion. The class will be taught with a bias against the ideological, eschewing progressive or conservative &quot;quick fixes,&quot; and emphasizing problem-solving, pragmatism, an openness to opposing viewpoints, and a willingness to acknowledge the trade-offs in every approach. Students will be expected to persuasively advocate for specific solutions--in class discussion and in writing--and to demonstrate an understanding of the limitations of those solutions.

This course will identify the greatest areas of weakness in the American political system, make sense of the most pressing threats facing democracy, and contemplate how democracy can be strengthened. With this them - in defense of democracy - in mind, we will examine several questions: What guiding principles, norms, and institutions organize and structure American politics, and how do they affect the health and effectiveness of American democracy? What do patterns of political participation and representation in the United States tell us about the health of our democracy? How do partisan and social identities breed hostility and antagonism among the mass public? How does information from the media and other sources advance or frustrate democratic outcomes? What does increased violence - political, racially motivated, or otherwise - reveal about the trajectory of democracy in the United States? This is a course built on the science of politics, and our aim is to bring the scientific study of politics to bear on these pressing questions.",

        "description": "This seminar-style course will explore additional foundational readings on organizational ethics (business, non-profit, and governmental organizations) and policy ethics. Themes will include, among others: AI and policy considerations; social media and policy considerations; race and police brutality incidents; national security (including cyber threats); the Iran nuclear agreement; non-profit organizations in the policy and US landscape; and various corporate matters. Organizing themes include, among others: ethics of leadership; ethics of persuasion and compromise; influence of bias in organizational and policy ethics; ethics of social movements; discrepancies between discourse and action; emotion and ethics; and interpreting and explaining ethics. In addition, the course will offer training in a wide variety of skills for effective communication of ethics for policy purposes (developing succinct arguments, presentations, website discourse, commenting in meetings and conferences, interviews, statement of personal views, interacting with the media and social media, and mapping complex ethical analysis). Most of the assignments allow students flexibility to explore topics of their choice. The objective is to engage actively and improve skills in a supportive environment. A short, analytically rigorous final paper in lieu of final exam. Attendance required. Grading will be based on short assignments, class participation, and the short final paper. The course is open to undergraduate and graduate students. Undergraduates will not be at a disadvantage. Everyone will be challenged. Students wishing to take the course who are unable to sign up within the enrollment limit should contact Dr. Susan Liautaud at susanl1@stanford.edu. Distinguished Career Institute Fellows are welcome and should contact Dr. Susan Liautaud directly at susanl1@stanford.edu. This three-credit seminar accompanies  PUBLPOL 134 Ethics on the Edge but can also be taken as a stand-alone course. *Please note the course is being offered for two units and therefore is ineligible for Ways credit in the 2019-20 academic year. Please note that this course will require one make-up evening session on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday in April in lieu of the final class session the first week of June, so the course ends before Memorial Day.",

        "description": "This course will explore changing notions of truth in a world in which technology, global risks, and societal developments are blurring the boundaries of humanity and boring through traditional notions of nation states, institutions, and human identity. We will ask one over-arching question: does truth matter anymore? If so, why and how? If not, why not? Either way, how does truth relate to ethical decision-making by individuals and institutions and to an ethical society? How does truth relate to a life well lived? Six themes will organize our exploration of more specific topics: science and subjectivity; identity; memory; authenticity; religious truth; and truth and the law. Examples of topics to be explored include, among others: truth and technology (from deep fakes to home devices); white supremacy;  DNA testing and the 'identify as' movement, and identity; University history (Rhodes, Georgetown slavery, Yale Calhoun College...); the connections among truth, memory, and history; new questions in gender and racial identity; Chinese beautifying app Meitu and other social media &quot;truth modifiers&quot;; the sharing economy; the impact of AI and DNA testing sites on legal truth. Scotty McClennan will explore truth through major literary characters and the impact of religion on truth. We will consider how we determine and verify the truth; how we &quot;do&quot; truth; the role of truth in ethical decision-making; the importance of truth to effective ethical policy; and the relationship of the truth to a life well lived. An analytically rigorous short final paper in lieu of exam. This three-credit seminar may be taken as a stand-alone course or may accompany  PUBLPOL 134 Ethics on the Edge to full the Public Policy major ethics requirement.

Students wishing to take the course who are unable to sign up within the enrollment limit should contact Dr. Susan Liautaud at susanliautaud@googlemail.com. *Public Policy majors taking the course to complete the core requirements and students taking the course for Ways credit must obtain a letter grade.

Law, among its other benefits, can serve as a mechanism to harmonize private incentives with cooperative gains, to maintain an equitable division of those gains, and to deter social defection and dystopia. Law is thus an implementation of the social contract and essential to civilization. Economic analysis of law focuses on the welfare-enhancing incentive effects of law (and of law enforcement). More generally, we study the law's role in reducing the risks of cooperation, achieved by fixing expectations of what courts or the state will do in possible futures. Prerequisite: ECON 50.

        "description": "(Formerly GEOLSCI 118Y and 218Y) The complex urban problems affecting quality of life in the Bay Area, from housing affordability and transportation congestion to economic vitality and social justice, are already perceived by many to be intractable, and will likely be exacerbated by climate change and other emerging environmental and technological forces. Reforming urban systems to improve the equity, resilience and sustainability of communities will require new collaborative methods of assessment, goal setting, and problem solving across governments, markets, and communities. It will also require academic institutions to develop new models of co-production of knowledge across research, education, and practice. This XYZ course series is designed to immerse students in co-production for social change. The course sequence covers scientific research and ethical reasoning, skillsets in data-driven and qualitative analysis, and practical experience working with local partners on urban challenges that can empower students to drive responsible systems change in their future careers. The Autumn (X) and Winter (Y) courses are focused on basic and advanced skills, respectively, and completion is a prerequisite for participation in the Spring (Z) practicum quarter, which engages teams in real-world projects with Bay Area local governments or community groups. X and Y are composed of four weekly pedagogical components: (A) lectures; (B) writing prompts linked with small group discussion; (C) lab and self-guided tutorials on the R programming language; and (D) R data analysis assignments. Open to undergraduate and graduate students in any major. For more information, visit http://bay.stanford.edu/education. Cardinal Course certified by the Haas Center.

        "description": "This course seeks to prepare future policymakers and industry leaders for the complex debate surrounding the development and employment of automated and autonomous weapons for warfare. Exploring the developmental, legal, ethical, and operational considerations of introducing automated and autonomous systems into warfare, the course will seek to create a broad understanding of strategic opportunities and risk. The course will begin by examining the principles and functions of war to provide a baseline of why warfighters pursue automation and autonomy, and we will examine historical examples of how militaries have integrated these concepts in a variety of contexts. The course will then examine the relevant technologies - both those immediately available and those that push the future technological frontier. Those include computers, robotics, and artificial intelligence as well as the processes for turning technology into warfighting capability. In the final phase we will review applicable legal and policy regimes, and consider the ethical dilemmas created by the introduction of new automated and autonomous capability from military, governmental, commercial, and activist perspectives. A secondary objective of the course is to prepare students with a practical policymaking toolkit for analyzing and developing policy for a complex issue, with applicability beyond the issue of autonomy and warfare. This course encourages students to digest the information about autonomy and warfare, and to think creatively and practically about how policymakers and private sector leaders should address them, through a series of simulations, briefings and written exercises, and exercises intended to represent the actual policymaking progress. This course does not advocate any policy position but instead seeks to foster a more complete understanding of why and how automated and autonomous systems are being integrated into warfare as well as a circumspect review of the advantages, risks, and opportunities. This is a seminar course with limited enrollment. Each class session will be divided into lecture/discussion format where each lecture will set the stage for a vigorous guided discussion. Students will be required to explore policy options and debate the advantages and risk inherent in each option. The course will also leverage industry, technology, policy, and operational experts to provide differing viewpoints and specialized knowledge and experience.",

        "description": "Cities and urban areas have always been transformed by major external changes like pandemics and public health crises. California is both in the midst of its greatest economic recession since the Great Depression and experiencing a pandemic that has the potential to reshape many aspects of life. Planning for cities and regions, however, is a long game that requires follow-through on decisions made sometimes over many decades. How do we balance the shocks to our assumptions from the current Covid world with the need to plan long-term for issues like affordable housing and equitable cities, and perhaps most fundamentally, prepare our cities and communities for the inevitability of climate change and climate impact? nnnnThis course takes an interdisciplinary view of the key contemporary planning topics in California. It does so from looking at the intersection of climate laws, land use changes, the need for housing, travel patterns and the availability of high quality jobs and employment. This course will give you an understanding of the roles of key levels of government, from the state to the region/metropolitan scale, to the city and county, down to the neighborhood and parcel level. it will give students insight into leading themes and issues of the day in California such as the future of downtowns, the role of high speed rail, the impact of telework, automation in the construction of housing, drawing from examples in San Jose and San Francisco, the Central Valley, the state legislature, Southern California. Within each of these topics we will look at the impact of decisions on equity as well as climate and the economy. nnnnThe instructors are Kristy Wang, formerly SPUR&iquest;s Community Planning Policy Director, and Egon Terplan, Senior Advisor for Economic Development and Transportation in the California Governor&iquest;s Office, formerly SPUR&iquest;s Regional Planning Director.

        "description": "(PUBLPOL 134, PUBLPOL 234 - 3 credits; Ways - ER; Same as LAW 7020) The objective of this course is to explore the increasing ethical challenges in a world in which technology, global risks, and societal developments are accelerating faster than our understanding and the law can keep pace. We will unravel the factors contributing to the seemingly pervasive failure of ethics today among organizations and leaders across all sectors: business, government, non-profit, and academia. A framework for ethical decision-making underpins the course. There is significant space for personal reflection and forming your own views on a wide range of issues. Prominent guest speakers will attend certain sessions interactively. The relationships among ethics and technology, culture, leadership, law, and global risks (inequality, privacy, financial system meltdown, cyber-terrorism, climate change, etc.) will inform discussion. A broad range of international topics might include: designer genetics; civilian space travel (Elon Musk's Mars plans); social media (Facebook Cambridge Analytica, on-line sex trafficking, monopolies); new devices (e.g. Amazon Alexa in hotel rooms); free speech on University campuses; opioid addiction; AI (from racism to the work challenge and beyond); corporate and financial sector scandals (Theranos, Wells Fargo fraudulent account creation, Volkswagen emissions testing manipulation); new corporate challenges (Google selling drones to the military and Facebook's new Libra crypto currency); and non-profit sector ethics challenges (NGOs engagement with ISIS and sexual misconduct in humanitarian aid [Oxfam case]). Final project in lieu of exam on a topic of student's choice.  Attendance required. Class participation important, with multiple opportunities to earn participation credit beyond speaking in class. Strong emphasis on rigorous analysis, critical thinking and testing ideas in real-world contexts.  Note that this course will require one make-up evening session on a Wednesday or Thursday in early May in lieu of the final class session on June 5. Permission numbers are required for enrollment and will be granted via application at https://forms.gle/56M29nzXE51cHSFX6. Applications will be accepted March 1-9. The course offers credit toward Public Policy core requirements (if taken in combination with PUBLPOL 103F) and Science, Technology, and Society majors, and it satisfies the undergraduate Ways of Thinking - ER requirement. The course is open to undergraduate and graduate students. Undergraduates will not be at a disadvantage. Everyone will be challenged. Students taking the course for Ways credit and Public Policy majors taking the course to complete the core requirements must obtain a letter grade. Others may take the course for a letter grade or C/NC. Students seeking credit for other majors should consult their departments.",

Using wildfires in California as a case study, the course assesses specific strategies, such as controlled burns and building codes, and a range of planning and policy measures that can be used to enhance climate resilience. In addition, it considers how climate change and development of forested exurban areas (among other factors) have influenced the size and severity of wildfires. The course also examines the obstacles communities face in selecting and implementing adaptation measures (e.g., resource constraints, incentives to develop in forested areas, inadequate policy enforcement, and weak inter-agency coordination). Officials from various Bay Area organizations contribute to aspects of the course; and students will present final papers to local government offcials. Limited enrollment. Students will be asked to prepare application essays on the first day of class. Course is intended for seniors and graduate students.",

Planners, policymakers, courts, and designers are exhorted to 'involve the public' in decision-making, but how can this aspiration be made a reality? We will explore methods and case studies of how participatory design can be used to support better communities. Our design work will focus on housing and urban governance. How can we garner more community input to shape the civic processes driving stable housing, legal protections, climate resilience, and equitable access to public services? How can we facilitate productive dialogue and pair strategy with meaningful interventions? How can we create culture-shifts in how people interact with government agencies and policymakers? Students will work on a civic design project with a real-world stakeholder, to explore how to apply these methods and case studies. We explore how to go beyond 'performative' outreach to move toward genuine community involvement that enhances democracy, justice, and the public interest.

This course will provide a broad overview of the scholarly field known as &quot;law and economics.&quot; The focus will be on how legal rules and institutions can correct market failures. We will discuss the economic function of contracts and, when contracts fail or are not feasible, the role of legal remedies to resolve disputes. We will also discuss at some length the choice between encouraging private parties to initiate legal actions to correct externalities and governmental actors, such as regulatory authorities. Extensive attention will be given to the economics of litigation, and to how private incentives to bring lawsuits differs from the social value of litigation. The economic motive to commit crimes, and the optimal governmental response to crime, will be studied in depth. Specific topics within the preceding broad themes include: the Coase Theorem; the tradeoff between the certainty and severity of punishment; the choice between ex ante and ex post sanctions; negligence versus strict liability; property rules; remedies for breach of contract; and the American rule versus the English rule for allocating litigation costs. Because this course is taught jointly with Law 7502 in the Law School, it will not be mathematically oriented; there are no prerequisites to take the course.",

        "description": "How should we judge the fairness of social institutions? This is the basic question of justice, and it is a crucial topic for students of public policy. Justice, the philosopher John Rawls famously argued, is the &quot;first virtue of social institutions ... laws and institutions no matter how efficient and well-arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust.&quot; Justice is an ethical question about how we as moral beings ought to treat one another, but it is also a profoundly practical question. All human endeavors require large-scale coordination of our actions, which we achieve through laws and institutions. But law without justice is merely mass coercion, neither desirable nor sustainable. In this class we examine some of the most influential theories of fairness in social cooperation, including utilitarianism, social contract theory, liberalism, socialism, and libertarianism, and talk through how we can use these theories to analyze, evaluate, and (re)design public policy. Key questions include: Under what conditions is inequality of wealth and income problematic, and why? What are rights, and why do they matter? How should we balance the needs of individuals against the claims of groups? This class is also meant to provide students with the critical tools to identify and remedy injustices. No experience with political theory is required or assumed, and students will learn the skills of how to do political theory and how to incorporate it into policy work as part of the course. Open only to graduate students; permission number required to enroll.",

        "description": "Geared towards graduate students and advanced undergraduates, this course aims to provide students with an interdisciplinary framework for thinking about both why and when new technology should be regulated, as well as how to create effective regulations and policies when the pace of technological innovation often far exceeds the pace at which laws and public policies can be made. Through case studies involving specific areas of emerging technology, we will explore the opportunities that new technologies provide for improvement to a broad range of human domains - including the physical and social sciences, healthcare, economics, equity/justice, and national security. At the same time, we will consider risks presented by those same technologies, learn about policies and regulatory structures (both public and private) aimed at mitigating those risks, and reflect on potential risks and opportunities associated with the regulatory process itself. Readings and discussions will touch on the nature of relationships among scientific and technological experts, public officials, activists, and ordinary citizens - including problems of science literacy and communication between policymakers and practitioners. Students from all schools are encouraged to enroll, with the aim of creating opportunities for students to engage in the type of cross-discipline dialogue we will be discussing in class. Specific case studies may include: consumer data privacy, facial recognition, election-related misinformation and disinformation, regulation of the metaverse, automation and machine learning in military technology.",

        "description": "This 2-credit course will examine vast changes driven by innovation both from within traditional finance and from new ecosystems in fintech among others. Breathtaking advances in financial theory, big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, computational capability, IoT, payment systems (e.g. blockchain, crypto currencies), new products (e.g. robo advising, digital lending, crowd funding, smart contracts), new trading processes (e.g. algorithmic trading, AI-driven sales &amp; trading), and new markets (e.g. ETFs, zero-cost products), among others are changing not only how financial and non-financial firms conduct business but also how investors and supervisors view the players and the markets.  nWe will discuss critical strategy, policy and legal issues, some resolved and others yet to be (e.g. failed business models, cyber challenges, financial warfare, fake news, bias problems, legal standing for cryptos). The course will feature perspectives from guest speakers including top finance executives and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs on up-to-the-minute challenges and opportunities in finance. nWe will discuss slowing global growth against the backdrop of ongoing intervention and wildcards in the capital markets of the U.S., Europe, Hong Kong, Singapore, China, India, Japan, the Middle East and Latin America. We will look forward at strategic opportunities and power players appearing and being dethroned in the markets to discuss who is likely to thrive &iquest; and not survive &iquest; in the new global financial landscape. nnPrerequisites: If you are an undergraduate wishing to take this course, apply by completing the course application and provide a brief bio here: https://forms.gle/9BGYr8brdYwPS8Cu8",
