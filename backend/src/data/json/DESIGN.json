This course is intended for any student who is curious about the design major or wants to learn more about design. It is a required course for all design majors, and provides foundational understanding for subsequent coursework. This course is highly experiential and collaborative. We will cover core design methods through project-based learning and incorporate real world challenges. Students will experience how to prototype and test concepts, research needs, and how to synthesize insights from data to spark novel ideas. Each project will illuminate how design methods can be used to create positive impact in the world. The course will also help students understand possible career pathways for designers through an inspiring and diverse set of guest speakers and project leads.",

In this class we will examine the history of design, the challenges that designers at different historical moments have had to face and the ethical questions that have arisen from those choices. This class will explore a non-traditional view of design, looking at both the sung and unsung figures of history and question the choices they made, up to and including recent events in the Silicon Valley. Course work will include group projects as well as weekly writing. This course is required for undergraduate students in Product Design and, as such, priority will be given to these students.

In this course, students will be encouraged to clarify their personal and design values with respect to the impact they hope to make as human-centered designers. Class activities will prepare students practically for navigating their careers beyond Stanford. Outcomes will include supporting students in sourcing summer experiences, creating self-designed projects, developing their personal brand and story, and launching a digital portfolio. Throughout the course, Design Formation will allow students to build community in their cohort as well as with the broader design alumni community. Time will be afforded for students to synthesize and integrate material learned in their chosen method depth classes and domain classes. Finally, this course will prepare students to leverage these insights in service of their senior year capstone project.",

Imagine a process whereby you can close your eyes, and, after a few short weeks, leveraging established Design Principles, open them, and imagine/draw virtually anything that comes to mind. This is our pledge to you, independent of your previous sketching experience. This course melds basics with Industrial Design discipline (which creates the aesthetic, experience of products and services), dividing it into two parts; the ability to representationally draw in three-dimensions, while exploring the nuances of form &amp; materials. ME110 initially focuses on the first component, building the structural foundation for perspective drawing, then introducing basic lighting and shading theory to 'complete the picture'. Analysis gives way to individual choice, as confidence builds. While we express &amp; explore solutions with traditional analog medium, we bridge 'the digital divide', expressing final projects in several media choices, stirring in portfolio &amp; professional advice enroute.",

        "description": "The new space industry has the potential to impact and sustain life on Earth and beyond. For example, emerging space technology can shape the way we design habitats, food, and spacecraft for low-Earth orbit or the Lunar surface, as well as the products we use here on Earth. However, this requires us to take a deeper look at the potential influence on humanity and pushes us to declare our life mission as a lens for what we engineer. The aim of this IntroSem is to help undergraduate students &quot;shoot for the moon&quot; and &quot;declare their mission&quot; via an integration of curriculum from aerospace engineering and human-centered design. In this 10-week course, students will engage with some of life's hardest questions: Who are you?; Why are you here (i.e., on Earth and at Stanford)?; What do you want?; and How will you get there (i.e., Mars or your dream job after Stanford)? In addition, students will pitch new space-related, human-centered technology to potential stakeholders. To give students exposure to actual careers in aerospace design and engineering, mentors from industry will be invited to engage with students throughout the course and provide feedback on design projects.  Are you go for launch?",

From lawn signs to newspapers to zines to posters to pamphlets to stickers, print has long been a catalyst for social change. Students will learn the historical and contemporary contexts, from Noname Book Club to Emory Douglas's prints for the Black Panther Party, and social movements that leverage print, as well as printed-matter production methods. Then we will produce works in select mediums such as silkscreen, letterpress, risograph, offset, and digital printing. This course will also include visits by experts in a social movement and print production methods. Students will also work in teams to produce original work. This class is open to undergraduates, graduates and fellows. For those who are curious about experimenting with words/letters, art, graffiti, graphic design, design as a tool, and words as a catalyst this is the class for you. If you are interested but unsure about your eligibility, please send us an email.",

Why finance needs redesigning is one of the many questions we will investigate in this course. Students will explore the history of financial institutions in this country, take their design thinking skills into the field, and reimagine solutions beyond today's reality. Past years' classes have given students access to executives from Apple, Munich Reinsurance, Bank of the West, Silicon Valley Bank and Wells Fargo, the community of Paradise California, pioneering small-to-medium sized businesses founded by diverse trailblazers, and professional and student athletes seeking to manage personal finance and wealth.",

If we want everyday life to become healthier by default, we need to shift our interventions from downstream to upstream, from healthcare to the places where we live, learn, work, and play. Upstreaming health means making a deliberate effort to create patterns of everyday life that keep people well - physically, emotionally, financially, and socially. In Upstreaming Health, we will explore systems that influence health, health equity, and sustainability, integrating concepts from public health, systems thinking, and design justice and use tools from product and policy design to answer the question: How might we upstream health for all people? Through community-engaged projects, students will prototype possibilities for upstreaming health at a population-level.",

These patients have volunteered and been referred to our class by one of the teachers of the course, Dr. Nancy Cuan MD, who helps to lead the Stanford Coordinated Care Clinic. There will be two personal health projects with different partners to improve some self-chosen aspects of your own health.

One in 4 adults in the US has an adverse child experience, which is associated with lifetime risks of mental and physical chronic health conditions.  By applying &quot;health literacy&quot; as a lens in the constraint of pediatric primary care, we aim to develop key insights and to design solutions to these key challenges - with a focus on children, families and communities that have been historically and systematically undeserved. To do so, we will listen deeply to expert perspectives from healthcare workers, community leaders, and family members. We will apply human-centered design and related methodologies in real-world settings (hospital, clinics and homes), responsive to problems prioritized by system leaders. We will address questions that arise when seeking to address literacy and language barriers to highly efficacious care for those in greatest need.  Parents will be trained alongside Students with design skills to tackle this challenge. Results of this work will inform redesign across the &amp;gt;3000 pediatric clinics serving low-income communities through the Reach Out and Read National Network.",

Responsive to real-world challenges from a healthcare partner, students will work with patients with chronic illness (and their caregivers) to co-design solutions that reimagine the future of primary care. To understand these challenges, we will explore the intersections among epidemiology of chronic illness, fiscal and policy constraints, and social well-being.  We will place a special emphasis on the practical challenge of delivering the right care, at the right place and time.

        "description": "Legal aid groups, government agencies, and state courts offer free help to people experiencing housing, debt, family, and other major life problems. This policy lab will examine how to make this legal help more accessible, trusted, and impactful. How can more people be aware and empowered to use legal help, especially in a more equitable way?  Students in this policy lab will research and design national strategies for making legal help and government services more discoverable, user-friendly, and trustworthy. Students will conduct user research, technology experiments, and legal research to identify what specific initiatives might make legal help more engaging and impactful.  The students will be able to explore a range of new kinds of innovations from technology, to community partnerships, to service design--and help justice organizations make a coherent strategy for increasing uptake and engagement with their public services.  This class is open to Stanford Law students, and available for cross-registration for graduate and undergraduate students from across campus. We encourage students from outside the Law School to apply. Students will be working together in small teams.  Grading will be based on presentations, written assignments, class participation, and group work.

        "description": "This policy lab will build on the work of the Fall 2022 policy lab that researched three specific issues related to the Dobbs decision: medical abortion, restrictions on travel, and issues related to the collection and dissemination of information between and among providers and patients. The goal of the Spring 2023 policy lab is to develop a strategy for getting the information developed in the Fall 2022 policy lab to the field. In particular, students in the policy lab will identify how service providers and funders effectively receive information (offline through community-driven programs or online through websites and working with Google search and other engines) and specifically how they are obtaining information related to state abortion laws. The students will identify and speak with relevant legal and policy organizations to determine how they share legal information with funders and service providers. This &quot;market research&quot; will help inform (1) who our client should be and (2) what kind of materials (offline v. online) we should develop (what forms work best, how should the information be presented and executed?) In the last few weeks of the quarter, the students will propose and develop initial drafts of those materials.  Given that the terrain is rapidly changing, students will likely update the legal information collected by the Fall 2022 policy lab to ensure it remains accurate.

In this advanced negotiation course, we will crack open some of the fundamental negotiation principles and show you how, where and why design thinking can add unique value to your negotiation skills and outcomes. Mapping and designing the structure and process of your negotiation; understanding tools to gain empathy for the stakeholders involved; learning different styles of negotiation; practicing spontaneity, adaptability and presence in the moment; teamwork in preparation and team dynamics in the execution of a negotiation. You will work through exercises that isolate these skills and then apply them in simulated negotiations, at least one in every class session, to improve your confidence and competence as a negotiator. This course requires an application and acceptance by the instructors. If you have already taken a basic negotiation course, or have demonstrable professional negotiation experience, we invite you to apply. No previous design thinking experience is required, though certainly useful.",

We will then work closely with a local partner to develop meaningful design solutions that support a more just food system. Students will have the opportunity to explore the roles that both food and belonging play in their lives and the lives of people in local communities who represent a diversity of backgrounds and lived experiences. Through exercises and project work students will learn to explore with awareness and will be encouraged to develop their own understanding of both food justice and design for belonging.

Today's emerging technologies, which span everything from deep fakes to self-driving vehicles, have incredible capabilities, and at the same time are plagued with algorithmic bias and lack accountability. What can we learn from our precarious past that we are not learning today, but need to?

        "description": "This is an intense course in product design and development offered to graduate students only (no exceptions). In just ten weeks, we will apply principles of design thinking to the real-life challenge of imagining, prototyping, testing and iterating, building, pricing, marketing, distributing and selling your product or service. You will work hard on both sides of your brain. You will experience the joy of success and the (passing) pain of failure along the way. This course is an excellent chance to practice design thinking in a demanding, fast-paced, results-oriented group with support from faculty and industry leaders. This course may change your life. We will treat each team and idea as a real start-up, so the work will be intense. If you do not have a passionate and overwhelming urge to start a business or launch a product or service, this class will not be a fit.
