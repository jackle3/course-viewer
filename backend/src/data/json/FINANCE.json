We cover the tools of modern asset allocation and manager selection with a special focus on the challenges posed by alternative asset classes (hedge funds and private equity). To provide additional context, Ana Marshall will lecture on best practices in asset allocation and manager selection. Scott Gladstone, the developer of the Aladdin asset management tool at Blackrock, will introduce the class to this new tool. Students enrolled in the course will get access to Aladdin. The course material is founded on insights from modern finance and the economics of delegated asset management, complemented by industry perspectives. The target audience for this course includes all students who are interested in careers or already have careers in asset management. The course objective is to help you develop an understanding of the main challenges in the asset allocation and manager selection process, and hand you the tools to navigate these challenges.",

F321 is a 2-unit compressed course that meets MWF from 2:30-5:30pm during Weeks 1 and 8 of the quarter. It addresses real-world applications of business analysis and valuation tools and teaches the skills necessary to evaluate investment opportunities. F319 is a 3-unit course that meets Tu/Th 12:40-2:00 PM throughout the quarter. Students delve into specific topics in private equity, venture capital, hedge funds, mutual funds and principal investing. Students can elect to take F319 graded or pass/fail. The Investments courses will make use of original case studies and teaching notes authored by the late Professor Jack McDonald and a team of course alumni from prior MBA classes. Case discussions and lecture discussions will be led by the teaching team and investors/principals who were involved. The Investments courses enable MBA students to learn a broad investing skillset and study the careers of outstanding investors.",

It is intended for those who plan careers in general management, private equity, credit and special situations investing, banking, turnaround management, or financial advisory services. The course examines how companies may use in-court or out-of-court tools and processes to renegotiate their key contracts with creditors and other stakeholders when they encounter challenging business situations. Students will explore the financial, strategic, and legal implications of workouts, bankruptcies, asset/363 sales, and exchange offers, as applied in the context of financially distressed companies. Topics include valuation, absolute priority, creditor committees, intercreditor conflicts, debtor-in-possession (DIP) financings, 'blocking' strategies, avoidance powers, contingent claims, tax considerations, international insolvency, and distressed investment strategy. In exploring these topics, the course focuses on the key legal and contractual rights that creditors and other counterparties possess, and how they may use these rights to optimize their negotiated outcomes in a restructuring. Students will gain the tools to identify distress before it occurs, analyze distressed companies, and design restructuring plans which create enterprise value while navigating various considerations.  They will also gain an understand of how to structure financial obligations upon origination in a way to lower the probability of financial distress. Finally, the course will examine the purpose of bankruptcy design and future policy implications. The course is lecture-focused in the beginning, but will become more interactive and case-focused later in the course as students acquire the skills they need to tackle key issues. Grading will be based upon class participation (50%), and a paper due at the end of the quarter (50%). For the paper, each student will select a distressed company currently in the market and design a restructuring plan for it.",

What is the lifetime income of general partners? What are optimal investment strategies for PE asset allocation? How to value PE assets and funds? The course is very applied, with a lot of real-life and live cases. The course features guest speakers: VC, buyout fund, fund of funds managers, limited partners.

Understanding beautiful theory, without the ability to apply it, is essentially useless. Conversely, creating state-of-the-art spreadsheets that apply incorrect theory is a waste of time. Here, we try to explicitly combine theory and application. The course will be divided into 6 modules, or topics. The first day of each module will be a lecture on an investment topic. Also provided is a team modeling project on the topic. The second day of each module will be a lab. The lab day will begin with modeling concepts (tips) designed to help you use Excel to implement the module's investment topic. After the tips are provided, the remainder of the lab day is devoted to teams working on their modeling project and allowing for Q&amp;A. On the third day of each module will be presentations and wrap-up.",

        "description": "Financial crises are as old as financial markets themselves. There are many similarities between historical events. The crisis of 2008, for example, is far from unique. More often than not financial crises are the result of bubbles in certain asset classes or can be linked to a specific form of financial innovation. This course gives an overview of the history of financial crises, asset price bubbles, banking collapses and debt crises. We start with the Tulip mania in 1636 and end with the recent Euro crisis. The purpose of the course is to understand the causes of past crises and to develop a conceptual framework that ties common elements together. We will discuss the lessons that we can draw for financial markets today.",

This course will study the main components of the money management industry: mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds and venture capital funds. It will also examine important users of the industry such as non profits, endowments and defined benefit pension funds. The emphasis of the course will not be on how fund managers make money, but rather on how the industry is organized, how managerial skill is assessed, how compensation is determined, and how economic rents are divided between managers and investors. The course will explore how competitive market forces interact with managerial skill and other market frictions to give rise to the observed organization of the industry.",

How are interest rates determined, and how does the Federal Reserve conduct monetary policy? How do Federal Reserve actions impact the US as well as other economies? What economic factors drive the yield curves in different bond markets? We will pay particular attention to the banking system, with an eye toward understanding the function, valuation, and regulation of banks. We touch on a number of topics including the role of the Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort during financial crises, unconventional monetary policy tools such as quantitative easing and forward guidance, cryptocurrency, and emerging market financial crises. We will often begin class with a discussion of current macro-financial market events in the context of our course coverage.",

We will integrate theories presented throughout the MBA core, particularly those from accounting and finance, and take a hands-on approach to understand how the theory is implemented in practice.The focus of the course will be on developing critical financial modeling skills, understanding best practices, and recognizing common pitfalls. Students will work on a series of cases and build models that can be used for earnings and pro-forma financial statement forecasts, valuation, the assessment of financing needs, merger analysis, and LBO evaluation.Students will also gain experience presenting financial models and critically assessing them. By the conclusion of the course, students will develop the skills to construct complex financial models and the logical frameworks to utilize them for various organizational applications.",

Throughout the sessions, students will be challenged to understand and explore the application and implementation of these different strategies. Trading simulations employed on the Rotman Interactive Trader will be used extensively in this course as a way to learn and test different strategies. All classes will be held in the Real-time Analytics and Investment Lab (RAIL), located on the third floor of the Bass Building (B312). Students are expected to attend all sessions. Grades are based on in-class simulation results, class participation, and two written assignments.",

The course takes a two-pronged approach: First, we develop tools and concepts of corporate finance related to modeling, valuation, control, and investment decisions within an entrepreneurial context. Second, we use cases with firms at different stages of their life cycles from initial angel or venture capital investments through exit decisions, in order to see the issues that arise when these principles are applied in practice. In some cases we show the viewpoint of the entrepreneur and in others the perspective of the investor. After all, as an entrepreneur, one cannot negotiate effectively without understanding an investor's motivations. Conversely, an investor cannot evaluate a potential investment opportunity without appreciating the entrepreneur's perspective and incentives. Finally, we explore new developments in entrepreneurial finance such as crowdfunding and early liquidity provisions.",

Current trends (including liberalization of markets and financial stability) will be emphasized. Coverage will be through lectures, reading of research, including primary source documents and secondary (journalistic and analyst) commentary. There will be a range of subject-matter-expert speakers. Using our special video-technology enabled classrooms at Stanford and at the Stanford Center at PKU, this course is able to draw live speakers in Beijing and to meet jointly with students at Beijing University. Students will participate actively in class discussion, make a 5-minute (per student in each group) research presentation, and submit a 10-page term paper.",

We will concentrate on how entrepreneurs and investors make and should make important decisions. Examples of issues that we will cover are: How can entrepreneurs raise funding successfully? What are typical mistakes entrepreneurs make in raising capital and negotiating with investors? How to choose your investor? How to pitch to an investor? How do angels and VCs generate and process their deal flow and select companies? How are VCs involved in business decisions such as recruiting talent and replacing CEOs? What are the important provisions of financial contracts between VCs and founders? How to value early-stage companies? The course is very applied and mostly case-based. We will discuss a lot of nitty-gritty details that is a must for founders and investors. Case protagonists, founders, angels, and VCs will be among guest speakers. No prior knowledge of the VC industry is needed.",

Grading will be based on class participation (40%), a midterm project (30%), and a final CFO case study project (30%). 25 CFOs from leading companies including the CFOs of AT&amp;T, DoorDash, General Mills, Qualcomm, Visa, and Wells Fargo have agreed to speak with student teams for the final case study project.  The teaching team is led by Jeff Epstein, former CFO of Oracle and board member at Kaiser Permanente, Twilio, Okta, Couchbase and AvePoint, and Mitesh Dhruv, former CFO of RingCentral and board member at ZoomInfo, along with Elena Gomez, CFO of Toast and board member at PagerDuty, Smartsheet and the U.C. Berkeley Haas School of Business, and Khozema Shipchandler, COO and former CFO of Twilio.",

The course looks at all aspects of private equity partnerships and private equity investing. The course may be of particular interest to five groups of students: (i) students who aspire to be employed in private equity as a career; (ii) students who plan to be employed by companies that are owned by private equity firms; (iii) students who may invest in private equity partnerships as a limited partner; (iv) students who find private equity to be an interesting part of the financial services industry, and (v) students who expect to participate in corporate business development or mergers and acquisitions. The course will meet for nine classes. Each class will have at least one senior partner from a private equity firm to comment on the activities of his firm. In years past, some of the true leaders of the industry have participated. One class will be a mock investment review committee presentation as a final project.",

        "description": "This is an advanced graduate-level course in international finance and macroeconomics. The course focuses on empirical methods, stylized facts, new advances in large-scale empirical work, and applied theory. This course is targeted to advanced second year PhD students. The course assumes familiarity with the basics of graduate-level macroeconomics and finance. Students without the necessary familiarity with these techniques are welcome to take the course, but should expect to have to fill the gaps on their own (and with the help of their classmates!). Given the target audience above, the course has three main objectives. 1) To introduce and investigate both classic and new economic issues at the frontier of current research in international finance and macroeconomics. The purely pedagogical part of the course aims to make students familiar with the questions, the current state of research, and the empirical tools currently being used. 2) To create a mental framework and intuitive understanding of important and active questions. What makes a question interesting? What makes a paper a good paper? How to develop a reasoned view of new (and perhaps yet un-studied) issues in international finance and macroeconomics? This objective is less direct and less formal, but aims to transition the students into full-time researchers. 3) To kick-start students on independent research. For those interested in applied work the course makes you familiar and tries to connect you with existing data at the frontier of the field, both public and proprietary. For those interested in theoretical work the course staff acts as a sounding board for early research ideas.",
