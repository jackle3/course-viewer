In this hybrid workshop-seminar, students will explore musical narratives by analyzing seminal concept albums and then producing their own single-story album through written lyrics. Students will examine how artists use craft elements such as setting, characters, and plot, cover art, and musical form and instrumentation, then apply that learning in their own productions. Creating music, beats, soundscapes, and artwork will be encouraged, but the final project need only be a cycle of recorded, spoken song lyrics.  We&iquest;ll focus in particular on narratives of race, class, gender, and sexuality and their social implications as we examine works from artists across musical genres&iquest;from classic and punk rock artists such as Pink Floyd, David Bowie, and Green Day; to hip-hop, pop, and EDM performers such as Beyonc&eacute;, Lupe Fiasco, Janelle Mon&aacute;e, Daft Punk, and Kendrick Lamar.

        "title": "Stories to Save Our Planet: Transforming Climate Solutions Research Into World-Changing Stories",
        "description": "The United Nations have called climate change the challenge of our generation. Fiorenza Micheli, Chair of Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, says that the problems of climate change are too complex and happening so fast that we &quot;have to co-create solutions from the start to address issues in sustainability and climate.&quot; Storytelling offers us the opportunity to witness and communicate the impact of climate change and bring clarity and understanding to its solutions. This course is designed to equip students with the skills, tools, and process to transform complicated climate solutions into compelling audio stories that show us how to protect and preserve the ecosystems that sustain life. This is a hybrid class, equal parts classic seminar and creative workshop. We'll study the work of climate storytellers and activists, examine the architecture of great stories in the audio form, and develop skills for interviewing, scriptwriting, storyboarding, voiceover narration, audio editing, and sound design. Students will work in small groups and emerge from the course having produced an audio documentary, memoir, or investigative story about climate change solutions, and the knowledge, tools, and experience to become more persuasive environmental storytellers and advocates. No prior experience with story craft or media required. Interested students should submit this form: https://forms.gle/Taa9TxYKk4fRDMhr7",
