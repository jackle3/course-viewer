        "description": "Conscious relationship is an invitation to discover ourselves more fully and to connect with others more authentically. Learn to live from healthy love, fall in intentional love, express genuine love, unpack the love you have known, and ask for the love that you want. In addition to theory and practice, instructors and invited guests will share how love has been healing, challenging, and transformational in their lives. Come and embody your own conscious love, a love that includes and builds upon the wisdom of your past; is modernized by the realness of who you are now; and can shape and propel the person you hope to become.",

Fraternity and sorority representatives will engage with one another within a small cohort of Violence Intervention and Prevention Chairs (VIP Chairs) and gain the skills and training necessary to create a culture of sexual citizenship, affirming the right of every individual to sexual self-determination while promoting care, equity, and accountability among all members of the community. VIP Chairs will learn how to facilitate a wide range of educational programs to cultivate a culture of sexual citizenship for their respective chapter and for the Greek community and Stanford community as a whole. The VIP Program was founded on the belief that students can cultivate change for themselves and their communities in relation to sexual and relationship violence by providing peer to peer education and support. This program is a best practice and national model and is open to any student who is a member of a recognized fraternity or sorority on campus.",
