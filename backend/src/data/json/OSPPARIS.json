        "description": "Since the turn of the 20th century, Paris has attracted both artists and migrants in large numbers, thanks to France's reputation as a haven for those seeking refuge from persecution and conflict, and its capital's longtime status as a global artistic center. This course will focus on the confluence of these two communities by exploring the art of migration from the 20th century to today&iquest;including painting, sculpture, drawing, street art, photography and video--with a focus on works representing France, or produced in France or by French artists.Beyond aesthetic considerations, many of the artists who formed part of the successive generations of the legendary 20th century &quot;School of Paris&quot;, and continue to enrich the Parisian art scene today, have also come fleeing various forms of persecution or turmoil in their home countries, from war to anti-Semitism to fascism to colonialism to terrorism.  The ways that these &quot;cultural migrants&quot; have represented their journey and negotiated their multi-layered identities in their work, both then and now, will be explored.  Current day migration in a post-colonial context will also be studied, as a means to discover the various strategies used by contemporary artists to humanize and give visibility to the struggle of the displaced, while addressing societal concerns fueling displacement today, including racial, social, religious and gender inequality, conflict, and climate change.Instructional format will include in-class lectures, discussions with contemporary artists, and above all, site visits to Parisian museums, neighborhoods and relevant socio-cultural institutions.  Students will be evaluated through in-class participation and attendance, an in-class presentation on an assigned artwork, and a research paper on a topic relevant to the course scope.",

From the trauma of the Great Revolution to the modern emergence of the Extreme Right, the experience of France has much to teach us: not only about how societies develop economically, and how to manage the political polarization and conflict that can often result, but also the role of new ideas in shaping the institutions of nations. In this course, we will study the latest ideas in Political Economics and Historical Political Economy in light of ideas and examples that draw from the French experience in comparative perspective. Each week we will pair a core concept in political economics with a detailed study of how the methods of social science history can shed new light on a particular crisis or episode in France&iquest;s development. The aim will be to understand what lessons we might draw for reducing political polarization and conflict not only in France but around the world.",

        "description": "This course proposes to explore art and politics in France from the revolution to the present. Through a multimedia approach - including sculptures, paintings, prints, commemorative monuments, architecture, street art and photographs - we will retrace the changing forms that some of the most salient political messages have taken in modern French art. The course will follow a chronological progression, from Revolution to Empire, followed by the rise and fall of the IInd Empire, and the resulting thirst for revenge. We will then broach the 20th century, including the politics of the avant-garde, the art of colonialism, the varied aesthetic responses to the rise of totalitarianism, on display at the 1937 World's Fair in Paris, and evident in the art of collaboration and resistance produced in Occupied and Vichy France during the Second World War. The art of 1960s countercultural contestation - anti-capitalist, anti-colonial, feminist, etc.--will then be studied, before examining recent initiatives in the realm of commemorative art and cultural display that approach issues facing contemporary French society today, including terrorism and constructively confronting its colonial legacy.",

It will center on the understanding of the place of the French capital city in the production of writers (including food writers), filmmakers, visual artists, architects, public intellectuals from Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, and from the French citizens of the so-called 'second and third generations' of migrant parents from the Maghreb. We will examine foundational works while considering their engagement with the historical and political contexts in which they were produced, conveying the changing aspects of Parisian social landscape in the broader Francophone cultures of Paris (e.g. examining the dialogue with Francophone artists from Sub-Saharan Africa). The diverse topics discussed will include migration, colonialism and decolonization, political and social dissent, national and cultural identity, the politics of language, race and class, gender and sexuality, orality and textuality, and transmediterranean dynamics. We will analyse recent initiatives in the realm of commemorative events of the colonial past and its legacy, specifically of diverse controversies facing contemporary French and North African societies today. We will also have the opportunity to interact with some of the authors as special guests: Benjamin Stora, Le&iuml;la Slimani, Sophia Aouine, Tarik Oualalou. Class-visits to the Institut du Monde Arabe, Great Mosque of Paris, Palais de la Porte Dor&eacute;e, Jewish North African quarters (Le Marais, Belleville), cooking class and couscous lunch in the Latin Quarter",

This course will explore street or urban art's evolution from a criminal act by anonymous, marginalized figures to an esteemed, lucrative and increasingly officially-sponsored cultural practice.  The focus will be street art in Paris.  Long considered an international artistic capital, Paris is seen today as one of the most dynamic centers of contemporary street art, since its emergence in the 1960s.  The course will address the multiple forms, techniques and labels used in relation to urban or street art, while exploring prevalent themes broached, including racial and gender inequality, anti-capitalism and climate activism.  The motivations, goals, and inspirations of both renowned and emerging practitioners in Paris and beyond will be studied to place street art in a wider art historical and activist context.  Throughout the course, the paradoxical notions surrounding contemporary street art will be considered: revolt versus appropriation, urban degradation versus beautification and even speculation, delinquency versus activism, anonymity versus stardom, street versus screen. Forms of instruction will include in-class discussions and debates, student presentations, guest lectures by street artists and other cultural actors, site visits to community and cultural institutions and city walks to explore the writing on the walls in diverse Parisian neighborhoods.",

        "description": "The workshop will give students the opportunity to learn about France through the prism of its television and documentary production. This comparative approach to media and film will encourage students to analyze the ethical stakes surrounding creative and editorial decisions in France and the United States. Through visits to television sets and control rooms, interviews with producers and directors, and screenings of documentaries and films, students will learn to decipher French culture through the specific storytelling techniques used in news reports, series, documentaries and films. Each class session will focus on a television program, news broadcast, documentary or fiction film. Industry professionals working in television and film will be invited to class to share their expertise and interact with students. With more than 373 movie theaters located throughout 20 arrondissements, Paris, is truly the world capital of Cinema. Approximately a hundred theaters are considered independent movie houses, some of which are classified as historical monuments. This unique situation will allow students to learn about the origins of cinema and the importance of film to French culture during class field trips. The professor will provide technical guidance about news reporting and film production in general and how to make a short documentary. As a final project each student will create a personal 2-3 minute short film using their smart phone about a theme relating to their time in Paris. Class time will be spent on finding a story idea, creating an outline, and filming and editing their film. Language of Instruction: French, Prerequisites: none",

How does science function as a way of understanding our world, and - importantly - how does it differ from other approaches? As its point of departure, this course will examine and critique selected episodes of the television series, MythBusters (Discovery Channel), which tests the validity of many popular beliefs in a variety of imaginative ways, including myths, rumors, traditions, and stories. We will take the opportunity to delve more deeply into the applicability of the scientific method in understanding a vast range of real-world problems, and into the practical acquisition of fact-based knowledge, which together form the cornerstone of all science. The intellectual framework of this course will be based, first and foremost, on skeptical inquiry, combined with the other key ingredients of good science, which include:  framing the question well, careful experimental design, meticulous observation and measurement, quantitative analysis and modeling, the evaluation of statistical significance, recovery from failure, disseminating findings, and the continuous cycle of hypothesis and testing.  This course is taught at an introductory level, but it pays serious attention to the quantitative treatment of experimental data and associated tests of statistical significance. All students taking the course will be expected to learn, and to work a series of problems in, basic probability and statistics. There is also a hands-on, &quot;dorm lab&quot; component that involves some fabrication and a significant amount of individual testing and measurement. The final course project will involve developing and writing a scientific grant proposal to test a myth.",

        "description": "How does Paris obtain its fresh food for the 8 millions meals that are served every day in the city? Where is this food produced and how is it brought to the city? What recent initiatives promote a more sustainable food system in France? These questions offer an opportunity to explore broader issues related to food systems in the urban era, rural-urban linkages, and sustainable food consumption, using Paris as a case study. The objective of this course is to better understand the food system of a large citysuch as Paris, with a focus on the underlying human-environment interactions. Part I of the course will focus on food production in the peri-urban areas of Paris and other regions in France. 70% of the food consumed in Paris comes from France. We will start with von Thunen's model of the central state.We will also discuss the rise of urban agriculture, with a field visit of an urban agriculture site under the municipality's &quot;Parisculteurs&quot;program. Part II will focus on food distribution and consumption in the city. We will discuss concepts such as agglomeration economies and supply chains. We will conduct interviews atan open-air market in Paris where &laquo;mara&icirc;chers&raquo; bring in their own production to sell. Part III will focus on recent trends to increase the sustainability of food production in France. We will discuss emerging social norms related to sustainable food and how they interact with agricultural and environmental policies in France and the European Union. This will include the rise of organic agriculture, geographical indications, various public and private eco-labeling initiatives, and attitudes toward genetically-modified crops in France.",

What are the causes, and environmental and social implications of this &quot;forest transition&quot;?(2) Organic agriculture in France:In 2018, the cultivated area under organic agriculture in France was 20% larger than in 2015, representing nearly 6% of the total cultivated area. What explains this trend? How is the organic agriculture standard defined in Europe? What are the health and environmental benefits of organic agriculture?(3) Outsourcing ecological footprints to other continents:The environmental impacts of France's consumption within its borders are decreasing. But does it reflect a decoupling between economic activity and environmental degradation, or is it just the result of a displacement of the most polluting activities to other countries? (4) Sustainability sourcing commitments by corporate actors: A growing number of multinational corporations are making sustainability sourcing commitments. Does the country (or continent) where these companies are based or sell their products have an influence on the likelihood of making such commitments?(5) Geographical Indications (GIs) in Europe: GIs identify a good as originating from a region where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is attributable to its geographical origin. More than 6,000 of the 10,300 products that benefit from GIs in the world are produced in the European Union. What are the benefits of GIs for producers and consumers?",

In the present time of globalization, these dynamics have posed particular political and social challenges in both the United States and Europe and have thus commanded the attention of scholars working in diverse disciplines on both sides of the Atlantic.  Immigration and citizenship have been among the most central topics in social sciences in the last 25 years. National history in the United States, immigration in the European context is the result of the reconstruction of the economy after WWII and of the decolonization of the 1960s. Today with the settlement of economic and postcolonial migrants the question is raised in terms of integration and national unity, sovereignty and identity. The seminar will emphasize changes and continuity, convergences and divergences among policies, rhetoric and approaches with regard to immigration, incorporation and citizenship in Western democracies. New developments with regard to migration policies and their effect on identity politics, institutional arrangements, multiculturalism, secularism and religion, as well as on the modes of organization, mobilizations and claims of immigrants or minorities will be analyzed. Based on empirical researches, theoretical reflections and normative considerations, the seminar will question will the terms of citizenship, membership and allegiance, and the changing relationship between citizenship, rights, identities, culture and politics.

        "description": "The human genome carries the instructions for normal human development and reproduction. But it also carries predispositions to disease, and clues to our evolution, ancestry, and identity. The genome may also be pliable to environmental influences and genetic engineering. Through directed readings, activities and Paris field trips, students will learn about the human genome and applications of genome science and technology across diverse disciplines including medicine, comparative and evolutionary biology, paternity testing and forensics. A particular emphasis will be France's contributions to genome science, and uniquely French perspectives on the ethical, legal, and societal implications. The broad goal is to become informed and engaged about genome science and its impact on both the individual and society.",

        "description": "By the 1720's, Paris was widely viewed as the center of European culture and politics. &quot;How can anyone be Persian?&quot; asked a fictional Parisian in Montesquieu's Persian Letters (the implication was that anything other than being Parisian was slightly ludicrous). Eighteenth-century writers, scientists, and aristocrats sought to burnish Paris's reputation as the capital of modern thought and worldly sophistication, from which Enlightenment radiated. Visitors eagerly sought admittance to the famous salons, attended the theater, and watched public scientific displays. But by the end of the century, the novelty promised by the French philosophes took on a revolutionary dimension. Now the streets of Paris provided the stage for some of the most momentous historical events in Europe, from the storming of the Bastille to the execution of Louis XVI. And the ramifications of this revolution echoed throughout the nineteenth century, both in Paris and beyond.In this course, you will study the cultural and political history of Paris using the city itself as a classroom. Whenever possible, you will explore the role of salons, scientific academies, museums, and coffee shops by both studying and visiting them in person. You will examine the sites of revolutionary events and consider how they are commemorated (or not). And you will discover how some of the most striking features of Paris -- its grands boulevards, with their elegant apartment blocks -- reflect lasting fears of a revolutionary people.",

In this course we will map the spatial presence of the avant-garde of African-American artists in Paris and how their being in the City of Light has inherently shaped the French Capital and its understanding of alterity throughout the twentieth and the twenty-first century. We will not only focus on the Parisian connections and the long-lasting imprint they left on Paris by othering the urban landscape, offering alternative conceptions of the parisian territories for generations of Black and non-Black artists to come, but also on their own journeys of self-discovering and intellectual awakening in the streets of Paris: how Paris transforms them and how they transform Paris. From Richard Wright to Beyonc&iquest;, from James Baldwin to Ta-Nehisi Coates, from Josephine Baker to Thomas Chatterton Williams, from Beverly Loraine Greene to Angela Davis &amp; Black Lives Matter in Paris : exploring how the pioneers of the Afro-American parisian diaspora paved the way for the future generations of Paris noir. From Caf&iquest; Tournon to the Louvre museum, from Montparnasse to La Sorbonne, from the Unesco headquarters co-designed by Beverly Loraine Greene the First African-American woman to be a registered architect in the USA, we will explore the ways those parisian territories, symbols of power, knowledge and French (non) art de vivre came to define the socio-political Paris of Afro-American artists and public intellectuals, and to refine their intimate vision of America from a distance.",

        "title": "Migration Matters in Cinema and Literature: Francophone Authors Inside Out",
        "description": "The 20th Century has seen numerous prodigious cultural productions of French artists with living roots in the former French colonies (North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Indochina), and the 21st century has already seen even greater ones. Navigating critical challenges faced by our human condition such as making sense of the world around us, self-expression and representation, migration and mobility, identity negotiations and sense of multi-belonging, the contemporary French artists (writers, filmmakers, architects, rappers) have found themselves at the center of French and Francophone cultural life for quite a while. This course will explore luvres from Leila Slimani's Chanson douce to Rachid Bouchareb's Indig&egrave;nes, taking side trips into the topsy-turvy world of Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis, the ingeniosity of Alain Mabanckou's Verre cass&eacute;, the poetic spleen of Stromae's Racine carr&eacute;e, the unapologetic French vision of Fatou Diome's Marianne porte plainte!, the fierce narrative of Kim Lef&egrave;vre's M&eacute;tisse blanche, and the inventive questioning of urban life in Djamel Klouche's architecture. We will consider the play of words, the strategies behind first-person narrative and compare it with the alternate third person and the &quot;we&quot; one in different art mediums. Why are so many authors and protagonists still obsessed with the Algerian War of Independence (1954-1962), 60 years after the end of the war? How does the move from an early almost exclusively male-dominated cultural scene to a more gender balanced one translate into their artistic productions ?",

        "description": "Short stories have been an important literary and cultural tradition in France since 1690. Classical authors, folktale writers, translators of &quot;oriental&quot; fictions, aristocrats, and femmes du monde have produced a large corpus of short stories. These stories are far from being mere fairy tales; they unveil the violence of the Early Modern period while revealing the horrors of social and domestic violence. This course has two goals: the first one is to present the nature, extent and causes of domestic, social, and everyday violence in absolute regimes of the early modern times. The second one is to &quot;read&quot; violence and the emotions linked to it in popular tale narratives. Our repertoire will include popular French tales, such as Les Contes de Perrault, and the philosophical and political tales of Rousseau, Diderot, and Voltaire. Our approach will be comparative, psychoanalytic, feminist, cross-cultural, sociological, and anthropological. Format: seminar. Taught in French.
