        "description": "&quot;last night a DJ saved my life&quot; --Indeep (1982 song)  In a moment that has been widely described being defined by &quot;remix culture,&quot; what might we learn from the traditions and practices of the artists who gave us the remix? This course looks at the DJ as an crucial figure, a rhetor even, who influences both US and world culture and examines the DJ's practices as writing practices. From there we ask how other kinds of writing--public, academic, creative--can be informed by DJs and DJ culture.  We will study specific practices like scratching, remixing, and the mixtape as well as different approaches and spaces in which DJs have shaped culture, from disco to Hip Hop to world music, from radio DJs to party DJs to beat-juggling and turntablism. In addition to our readings, viewings and work in class, participants in the course will be able to participate in a DJ workshop introducing basic techniques like mixing, and will attend at least 1 live DJ set in San Francisco or Oakland. The course will make turntables and a DJ controller available for students to work on mixes and DJ techniques live, in class.",

        "description": "This course is an exploration. Most generally, its aim is to identify distinguishing features of good diverse communities and articulate them well enough to offer principles or guidelines for how to design and manage such communities - all with a particular focus on educational communities like schools, universities, academic disciplines, etc., but with the hope that such principles might generalize to other kinds of organizations and the broader society. The readings range from those on the origins of human communities and social identities to those on intergroup trust building. They also aim to embed our discussions in the major diversity issues of the day, or example, what's in the news about campus life. Thus the course has a practical purpose: to develop testable ideas for improving the comfort level, fairness and goodness-for-all of identity diverse communities--especially in educational settings. The course also has a basic science purpose: to explore the psychological significance of community. Is there a psychological need for community? Is there something about a need for community that can't be reduced to other needs, for example, for a gender, racial or sexual-orientation identity? How strong is the need for community against other needs? What kinds of human groupings can satisfy it? In meeting this need, can membership in one community substitute for membership in others?  What do people need from communities in order to thrive in them? Do strong diverse communities dampen intergroup biases? Can strong community loyalty mitigate identity tensions within communities?  Such questions, the hope is, will help us develop a more systematic understanding of the challenges and opportunities inherent in diverse human communities.",

What contributes to the high levels of innumeracy in the general population? Why do girls and women opt out of math when they get a chance? In this seminar we will consider seminal research on math learning in K-12 classrooms, including a focus on equity. We will spend time investigating cases of teaching and learning, through watching videos and visiting schools. This seminar is for those who are interested in education, and who would like to learn about ways to help students (and maybe yourselves?) learn and enjoy mathematics. If you have had bad math experiences and would like to understand them - and put them behind you - this seminar will be particularly good for you. The final project for this class will involve developing a case of one or more math learners, investigating their journeys in the world of math.",

For the past four years, American democracy has been in continual crisis. Bitter and differing views of what constitutes truth have resulted in a deeply polarized electoral process. The sharp increase in partisanship has crippled our ability as a nation to address and resolve the complex issues facing us. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;There are reasons to hope the current challenges will be overcome and the path of our democracy will be reset on a sound basis. But that will require a shift to constructive--rather than destructive--political conflict. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This Sophomore Seminar will focus on U.S. democracy and will use a series of case studies of major events in our national history to explore what happened and why to American democracy at key pressure points. This historical exploration will shed light on how the current challenges facing American democracy might best be handled. (Cardinal Course certified by the Haas Center).",

We will connect historical patterns with contemporary issues in some of this nations largest urban school districts in order to uncover the ways in which urban schools both reflect and reproduce structural inequalities that marginalize Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x youth. As we consider the origins and persistence of educational inequalities in relation to longstanding forms of violence, domination, and subordination, we will also highlight histories of activism and resistance, including organized struggles for educational justice in Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x communities. Issues to be addressed include school (de)segregation, standardized testing, educational tracking, unequal opportunities to learn, deficit perspectives, bilingualism and bilingual education, immigration and undocumented students, ethnic studies curricula, and culturally relevant/responsive/sustaining approaches to pedagogy.  This course will invite students to visit and observe in urban school settings, interview key stakeholders (students, parents, teachers, and/or policy makers), and reflect on their own K-12 schooling experiences in relation to course themes.",

        "description": "This course draws on intersectional and interdisciplinary approaches to introduce students to the range of issues, experiences, and methodologies that form the foundation of Latina/o/x studies. By considering the relationship between the creation of &quot;Latinx&quot; and &quot;American&quot; identities, students will critically reconsider the borders that constitute the U.S. as a political and cultural formation. The course balances depth and breadth in its study of the variety of perspectives and experiences that come to be associated with U.S. Latinxs.  Thus, we will analyze the histories of predominant U.S. Latinx sub-groups, such as Mexicans/Chicanxs and Puerto Ricans, while also incorporating considerations of the ways in which broader populations with ties to Central America, South America, and the Caribbean play crucial roles in constituting U.S. Latinx identities. Topics include the U.S./Mexico border and the borderlands; (im)migration and diaspora; literary and cultural traditions; music and expressive practices; labor and structural inequality; social movements; Latinx urbanism; gender and sexuality; political and economic shifts; and inter- and intra-group relations. Sources include a range of social science and humanities scholarship. This course will meet at Sequoia High School. Transportation will be provided.",

        "description": "American higher education has had to continually struggle with issues of difference, particularly racial and ethnic cultural difference, throughout its history. While the civil rights and student protest era of the 1960s are easily recognized as moments of cultural struggle, they evolve and take new forms, extending and re-framing ideological and material conflict in the academy. These include battles over: the content of the curriculum; access to college and admissions; and the domains of legitimate knowledge. In this course, we will critically examine and discuss the research and discourse concerning issues of diversity and equity in the current era. We will examine the political, cultural, and social contours of these issues and as well as the efficacy of campus responses to them such as race-conscious admissions policies, identity-based offices, ethnic studies programs, and other DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) initiatives.",

        "description": "In this course we examine, explore, and develop practices supporting holistic college student development. We will examine classic cognitive theories of intellectual and ethical development (Perry, Baxter-Magolda), moral development and reasoning (Kohlberg, Gilligan), psychosocial development (Chickering and Reisser), and racial, ethnic, and religious identity development. We will also explore the development of capacities and qualities that are of growing contemporary interest including presence/mindfulness, authenticity/courage, compassion/empathy, and forgiveness/gratitude. We will also consider models of leadership that flow from holistic development. Lastly, we will introduce practices for the continued development of these cognitive, affective, and spiritual capacities. This course is appropriate for those interested in student/human development, student affairs, and leadership.",

        "description": "Listen Up! Introduces several skills intended to promote the development of active listening skills central to connecting and engaging with others more intentionally. The first four weeks of the course walk through a general framework for offering support in a peer helping role  while also introducing a wide range of skills and techniques designed to assist with gathering information, identifying and processing emotional experiences, and facilitating problem solving. In addition to these skills being central to the Bridge counsel and assisting people in distress, they are easily applied to interactions of all varieties. We encourage anyone who aspires to be more effective and intentional communicating with others to take this course. The second half of the course shifts to offering additional information and skills relevant to peer counseling and other helping roles, both personal and professional. Students will be QPR-certified, learn about interpersonal conflict, and begin to consider self-care as a helper. At the end of this course we hope you are equip with skills to approach your personal and professional relationships with more awareness, intention, and empathy.",

While focusing on contemporary schools, we will steep our discussion of curriculum in the thinking of Plato, Rousseau, Dewey and others who have made the curriculum of schools a part of a larger philosophical tradition. This work addresses the responsibilities of education in a democratic society by homing in on the meanings associated with learning, knowing, equality, and opportunity in an effort to rethink what are taken as the foundations of curriculum theory, policy, and practice. The course is timely given our current national debates about what should and should not be taught in schools, from Critical Race Theory and the 1619 Project to mandates around topics of gender and sexuality in the school curriculum.",

The course explores the principled basis of these ideas, how well they might (or might not) be defended against skeptical challenge, and how they might be applied in particular controversies about the rights of students, instructors, and researchers.",

What can we learn from studies in the developmental cognitive sciences and cognitive neurosciences of reward, attention, memory &amp; learning, motivation, stress, and self-regulation for tackling the behavioral design problems we face in crafting better socio-technical systems? This seminar course is designed to engage students in recent advances in this rapidly growing research area via discussions of both historical and late-breaking findings in the literature. By drawing on a breadth of studies ranging from cognitive development, cognitive neuroscience, and educational/training studies, students will gain an appreciation for specific ways interdisciplinary approaches can add value to specific programs of research.",

Much of this work takes place in formal educational environments including missionary and parochial schools, Muslim madrasas or Jewish yeshivot. However, even more takes place outside of school, as people develop skills and strategies in conversation with broader social trends.

One crucial next direction in artificial intelligence is to create artificial agents that learn in this flexible and robust way.

Theoretical perspectives on identity development will be reviewed, along with research on other social identity variables, such as social class, gender and regional identifications. New areas within this field such as the complexity of multiracial identity status and intersectional invisibility will also be discussed. Though the class will be rooted in psychology and psychological models of identity formation, no prior exposure to psychology is assumed and other disciplines-including cultural studies, feminist studies, and literature-will be incorporated into the course materials. Students will work with community partners to better understand the nuances of racial and ethnic identity development in different contexts.  (Cardinal Course certified by the Haas Center)",

This course will help you develop the skills and strategies necessary to effectively create and evaluate educational services and education technology startups much like educators, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, and venture capital investors do. Some questions we will discuss include: How do entrepreneurs, educators, and VCs evaluate and grow successful education and edtech startups? Why do most startups in edtech fail, and what are the key ingredients for success, especially in today's challenging times? What does it take to get venture capital financing in edtech? Each week will feature a different edtech entrepreneur as a guest speaker; these leaders hail from a variety of innovative for-profit and non-profit education technology startups. As we hear from the speakers, we'll evaluate all aspects of their invention, particularly in the context of emerging distance learning and hybrid learning trends. A fundamental question we'll explore in this course is how educators and technologists can better collaborate to leverage the scale and impact of technology to improve educational equity and access. This course will be taught in person and attendance at each session is required. The maximum capacity is 70 students. Juniors, Seniors and graduate students of all Stanford schools are welcome.",

CSCL is defined as a triadic structure of collaboration mediated by a computational artefact (participant-artifact-participant). CSCL encompasses two individuals performing a task together in a short time, small or class-sized groups, and students following the same course, digitally interacting.",

All students have an opportunity to represent elementary and high school students with disabilities in special education proceedings, to represent students in school discipline proceedings, or to work with community groups in advocating for the provision of better and more equitable educational opportunities to their children. In addition, the clinic may pursue a specific policy research and advocacy project that will result in a written policy brief and policy proposal. Students working on special education matters have the opportunity to handle all aspects of their clients' cases. Students working in this area interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, work with medical and mental health professionals and experts, conduct legal and educational research, create case plans, and represent clients at individual education program (IEP) team meetings, mediation or special education due process hearings. This work offers students a chance to study the relationship between individual special education advocacy and system-wide reform efforts such as impact litigation. Students working on school discipline matters interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, interview witnesses, conduct legal and educational research, create case plan, and represent clients at school discipline hearings such as expulsion hearings. Such hearings provide the opportunity to present oral and written argument, examine witnesses, and present evidence before a hearing officer. If appropriate and necessary, such proceedings also present the opportunity to represent students on appeal before the school district board of trustees or the county board of education. The education clinic includes two or three mandatory training sessions to be held at the beginning of the term, a weekly seminar that focuses on legal skills and issues in law and education policy, regular case review, and a one hour weekly meeting with the clinic instructor. Admission is by consent of instructor. Beginning with the 2009-2010 academic year, each of the Law School's clinical courses is being offered on a full-time basis for 12 credits.",

Begins with a methodology to help determine if a faculty career is a good fit for the values, interests and abilities of each participant. Progresses to an exploration of different types of faculty roles and different institutional contexts (e.g., tenure-track vs. non-tenure-track; research-intensive vs. teaching-intensive; large vs. small; etc.). Discusses how to identify and land a faculty position. Ends with concrete tips on how to thrive in such a role. May be repeated for credit.",

We will review different theoretical frameworks and empirical models that researchers employ to identify factors and processes that are associated with resilient or maladaptive developmental outcomes and trajectories over time. Finally, we will discuss how exemplar biological, family, school, cultural, and economic processes contribute to our understanding of children's adaptation and resilience. Throughout the course, we will discuss limitations of current research, directions for future research, and the translation of research findings for practitioners and policy makers. We will also consider equity issues relevant to studying adversity and adaptive functioning in diverse groups of children. Students will have the opportunity to apply the knowledge gained in the course to develop a research proposal that is aligned with their own interests and work.",

This demanding two-week, compressed course will provide passionate students with a brave space to develop and refine a plan for their own social change journey and amplify their potential to give, live and lead in a way that matters more. Using design thinking, students will challenge their preconceptions and wrestle with their social change approach, their privileged position as future Stanford graduates and philanthropy's role in society. Lectures and class discussions will inspire and prepare students to create social value with greater intentionality and humility. For the first class, students will submit a proposed social impact plan for their professional, philanthropic and civic lives. Over the course's six sessions, students will refine their plan, creating a formal theory of change that strategically utilizes their unique leadership platform and asset portfolio to advance opportunity and justice for a target population.

Stanford graduates will play important roles in solving many of today's and tomorrow's major societal problems -- such as improving educational and health outcomes, conserving energy, and reducing global poverty -- which call for actions by nonprofit, business, and hybrid organizations as well as governments. This course teaches skills and bodies of knowledge relevant to these roles through problems and case studies drawn from nonprofit organizations, for-profit social enterprises, and governments. Topics include designing, implementing, scaling, and evaluating social strategies; systems thinking; decision making under risk; psychological biases that adversely affect people's decisions; methods for influencing individuals' and organizations' behavior, ranging from incentives and penalties to &quot;nudges;&quot; human-centered design; corporate social responsibility; and pay-for-success programs. We will apply these concepts and tools to address an actual social problem facing Stanford University.

        "description": "(Same as GSBGEN 377). Our society implicitly prizes a particular approach to leadership - but today's cross-sectoral, impact-oriented leader cannot afford to be restricted to a single approach. If we aspire to address challenges across social, economic, and political arenas, with highly charged moral implications and multiple stakeholders, we have an imperative to use all available tools by discovering, celebrating, and advancing diversity in leadership. In this course, we will: (1) study a range of effective leadership approaches; (2) develop broad, transportable skills and frameworks required to lead in any complex setting - business, public sector, nonprofit sector; (3) delve into leadership tradeoffs and tensions; (4) explore and understand our own values and tacit and explicit decision-making criteria; and (5) recognize barriers to diversity and tactics to address them.  Guiding questions will include: How does the context shape the solution set? What does inspired and inspiring leadership look like? How do race/gender/other identities enter into the equation? How do I develop my own brand of leadership? We will examine contemporary leaders and controversies in education and elsewhere, draw upon timeless historical thinkers, enjoy the wisdom of guest speakers, and work intensively in small groups to highlight challenges, opportunities, and tradeoffs. By exploring a range of approaches and situations, we will strive for deeper understanding of ourselves and of the context to become a more capable, empathetic and effective leaders.",

Many of today's philanthropic institutions operate with unprecedented innovation and influence and lead in a way that rapidly adapts to society's ever-evolving needs, issues and crises. In this course we will look at the different types of philanthropic institutions (including foundations, LLCs and corporate philanthropy) that are driving this innovation and the diverse models that shape their operations and grantmaking. We will explore how to create philanthropic strategy, investment criteria, social change goals, short-, intermediate- and long-term indicators of success as well as how each of these factors merge to drive a unique grantmaking process. Students will drill down into the best practices of grantee-centric philanthropy as well as how to comprehensively assess nonprofits, evaluate grant proposals and make strategic funding recommendations. We will hear from globally renowned and new generation philanthropic leaders implementing the most innovative and impactful approaches across issue areas including climate change, movement building, policy change, voting rights, the arts and education, all through the lens of justice. Speakers will potentially include Laura Mu&ntilde;oz Arnold (Arnold Foundation), Crystal Hayling and Ashley Clark (Libra Foundation), Hal Harvey (Energy Innovation), Justin Steele (Google.org) and Jon Stryker (Arcus Foundation). Students will engage in skill-building assignments including informal assessments of local nonprofits and a formal, written assignment that entails analyzing actual grant proposals and presenting a hypothetical funding recommendation.",

        "description": "American higher education has had to continually struggle with issues of difference, particularly racial and ethnic cultural difference, throughout its history. While the civil rights and student protest era of the 1960s are easily recognized as moments of cultural struggle, they evolve and take new forms, extending and re-framing ideological and material conflict in the academy. These include battles over: the content of the curriculum; access to college and admissions; and the domains of legitimate knowledge. In this course, we will critically examine and discuss the research and discourse concerning issues of diversity and equity in the current era. We will examine the political, cultural, and social contours of these issues and as well as the efficacy of campus responses to them such as race-conscious admissions policies, identity-based offices, ethnic studies programs, and other DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) initiatives.",

We will examine classic cognitive theories of intellectual and ethical development (Perry, Baxter-Magolda), moral development and reasoning (Kohlberg, Gilligan), psychosocial development (Chickering and Reisser), and racial, ethnic, and religious identity development. We will also explore the development of capacities and qualities that are of growing contemporary interest including presence/mindfulness, authenticity/courage, compassion/empathy, and forgiveness/gratitude. We will also consider models of leadership that flow from holistic development. Lastly, we will introduce practices for the continued development of these cognitive, affective, and spiritual capacities. This course is appropriate for those interested in student/human development, student affairs, and leadership.",

In addition, we have guest speakers who are or were in higher education leadership positions to engage with us and share their perspectives on higher education leadership and administration. Graduate students in every discipline interested in becoming faculty members or administrators at universities or colleges need to understand these issues to learn how best to navigate the complexities.  Although higher education is our primary focus, we welcome students whose main interest is in an education-related organization such as a foundation, and we will help those students relate our discussions to their interests.",

Throughout the course, we will take a comparative perspective and highlight how different racial/ethnic formations (Asian, Black, Latino, Native American, White, etc.) participate in similar, yet different, ways of drawing racial and ethnic distinctions. The seminar will draw heavily on scholarship in (linguistic) anthropology, sociolinguistics and education. We will explore how we talk and don't talk about race, how we both position ourselves and are positioned by others, how the way we talk can have real consequences on the trajectory of our lives, and how, despite this, we all participate in maintaining racial and ethnic hierarchies and inequality more generally, particularly in schools.",

The course pays particular attention to how the educational philosophies of different African American thinkers reflected their conceptions of what shape freedom might take in the American context, and the tension between educational outlooks that sought inclusion or integration versus those that prized self-determination. We will also be attentive to the ways in which age, gender, geography, class, and color worked to influence the pursuit and achievement of various African American educational visions. This will be a 3-5 credit course and meet as a seminar open both to graduate students and advanced undergraduates.",

NOTE: This is online course where most of the work (readings, discussions, and assignments) will be completed by students working in pairs or in groups, online or face to face. There will be two in-person class meetings on campus at the assigned day and times, one in the third week of classes and one in the last. Course is variable units, but workload will not vary.

Significant questions have emerged about how digital and networked information technologies might be both narrowing and widening gaps in access to learning opportunities.  It is becoming clear that technology alone will not catalyze the forms of equity that are so essential for preparing young people and their families for a rapidly changing future.  Instead we need to deeply rethink and intentionally redesign the social organizations and tools that provide learning opportunities (schools, workplaces, community organizations, libraries) and study these innovations at a regional as well as national level.  In this course and public seminar, designed to foster new forms of collaboration and innovation, we will engage these questions through a series of invited conversations with a broad range of stakeholders including researchers, educators, and industry representatives.

The course will delve into assessment and learning analytics and how they can be used to support adult learning, including topics such data collection, analysis, visualization, performance tracking, designing effective assessments, adaptive learning, and using data to improve learning outcomes. The course supports students to conduct research, including how to formulate a good research question, when to use qualitative or quantitative methods, and the relative merits of theory-driven confirmatory vs. exploratory research. Throughout the course we will consider ethical issues related to design and research in human learning, Overall, this course will provide students with a strong foundation in the theory and practice of conducting research on adult learning in online environments, as well as the skills and knowledge needed to design, implement, and evaluate effective technology mediated learning environments.",

To do this we explore the intellectual lineage of intersectional thought from its Black Feminist roots and trace it through its use today in education research. Within these tracings, we will delve into the (mis)uses, contestations, and iterations of intersectionality in theory and empirical research. At the heart of this course is an examination of how perceptions of and beliefs about a myriad of intertwining inequities conspire to create vectors of oppressions that land in multiply &quot;marginalized students&quot; lives through the macrosociolpolitcal to the microinteractional. It interrogates the foundational ideological assumptions around culture, difference, deficit, and dis/ability in which education has traditionally been rooted. Students in the course will analyze the lineage and processes of intersectionality to understand how students at the intersections of multiple oppressions experience education within communities of practice that enact, reproduce, and resist policies and practices through their daily activities.",

We will study a myriad of innovative ways of doing intersectional scholarship and given the focus on robust methodological moves, this course will highlight questions of axiology of inquiry, analysis, and representation through an intersectional lens. Our class will investigate and create intersectional conceptual framing for designing and interpreting research. We will explore and develop qualitative or mixed&iquest;methods research data collection, analyses, holistic interpretation, and analytic writing from an intersectional perspective.",

This course is concerned with systems change processes: why we need them; what they look like; and what theories can be called upon to guide them.  We will examine the role of educational reform processes.  We will examine various conceptions how reform efforts bear on systems change efforts at all levels of education: the classroom, the school, the district, and the state and federal levels of educational policy. In this course, we will examine contemporary theories of educational systems change that pay close attention to Disability, Language, and Difference.  We will consider some examples of how these change processes interact to improve academic and social outcomes for all students, especially those who have been historically marginalized.  We will consider urban, suburban, and rural applications of these processes, as major sources of evidence for what works and what fails.  We will consider the &quot;big picture&quot; of our society, its values, and its economic position in a global economy to better understand why the need for systems change, which may seem obvious, is so difficult to achieve in practice.",

        "description": "(Same as STRAMGT 537) Public education in America is at a crossroads. Does our education system have what it takes to produce graduates who are prepared for college, career, and citizenship in our increasingly digital and pluralistic world? Will income and ethnic achievement gaps continue to be pervasive and persistent in our nation's largest urban cities? Will family zip code determine educational destiny for the next generation of students? Which strategies and reforms are truly demonstrating results and which are merely passing fads? As in all large-scale enterprises undergoing rapid, transformative change, leadership matters greatly. Fortunately, over the last decade, the reform of American public education has been led by a number of innovative and results-oriented leaders at the state, district and charter levels. These leaders are bringing additional urgency, strategies, and ideas designed to prepare America's schools and students for the century ahead. Some ideas are proving to be critical levers for change, others are facing significant political challenges, and others have not delivered on expected results. Many of them hold lessons for how future educational leaders can contribute to transforming public education for the next generation of K-12 students. This course will focus on school system leadership for education reform. The course will provide an overview of the critical issues facing K-12 public education in America today, and what is going on across the U.S. during this transformative period of change. Once this context is set, students will study education leaders and systems change strategies from the last 10-15 years at the state, district and charter levels. We will focus on leaders across five domains: Leadership in crisis situations, strategic leadership, china-breaking leadership, sustaining leadership, and next generation leadership. We will also look at leadership examples from outside K-12 education to broaden our thinking about what leadership styles and strategies could be successfully applied to education. Students will debate the strategies and efficacy of how different leaders approached systems-level change and will form their own working hypotheses of what is needed to help transform the American education system. Case studies in school system leadership will form the primary basis for classroom assignments and discussion. We will examine what went right and what went wrong in each case, focusing particularly on the decisions that school system leaders faced and the implications of their decisions. Most cases will be supplemented with research publications, technical notes, news clips, and/or videos to deepen students understanding of the context or issues discussed in the cases.

        "description": "Addressing the theoretical underpinnings of qualitative interviews as well as the application of theory to practice, this course considers different approaches to interviewing. Interview types covered will range from group interviews to individual interviews, and from unstructured, ethnographically oriented interviews to highly structured interviews. Working with community partners to facilitate application to practice, the students will move from theory to interview design, implementation, and initial stages of analysis, with an emphasis on consistency in approach and utility in graduate-level research.",

There is an emphasis on comparative work (i.e. looking between states/provinces or countries) and social science textbooks (i.e. history, civics, social studies, geography), but some flexibility to study a single context and/or other subjects (e.g. science, math) depending on data availability. Concretely, the aim is to finish the course with a rough draft of a research project that can be developed for future publication.",

        "description": "This course is aimed at students who have interest in learning about prevention science and community-based participatory research (CBPR) to address individual, family, community, and other contextual factors that influence development. Course topics will examine theoretical, empirical and practical foundations of prevention science and CBPR related to the design, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of interventions to prevent mental, behavioral and chemical health problems and promote healthy development. The course will cover the origins and multidisciplinary roots of both prevention science and CBPR, key concepts, current trends and directions, theoretical approaches, program development and assessment, science to service, evaluation methods, best practices, policy development, and implementation and dissemination approaches in community systems of care. Specific emphasis will be placed on the role of family systems and learning environments and on the need to incorporate a focus on structural inequalities based on race/ethnicity, geography, family structure, and other demographic variables into prevention-oriented research.",

        "description": "Everything we learn - be it a historical fact, the meaning of a new word, or a skill like reading, math, programming or playing the piano - depends on brain plasticity. The human brain's incredible capacity for learning is served by a variety of learning mechanisms that all result in changes in brain structure and function over different time scales. The goal of this course is to (a) provide an overview of different learning systems in the brain, (b) introduce methodologies and experiments that have led to new discoveries linking human brain plasticity and learning, (3) design an experiment, collect neuroimaging data, and measure the neurobiological underpinnings of learning in your own brain with MRI. The first section of the course will involve a series of lectures and discussions on the foundations of plasticity and learning with particular attention to experimental methods used in human neuroimaging studies. The second part of the course will involve workshops on designing and implementing experiments in MATLAB/Psychtoolbox or Python/PsychoPy. During this part of the course students will design, present and implement their own experiments as group projects. Finally, students will learn how to collect and analyze MRI data by being participants in their own fMRI experiments or analyzing publicly available datasets. Requirements: This class is designed for students who are interested in gaining hands-on experience with measuring the neurobiological underpinnings of learning. Student projects will involve designing experiments, collecting and analyzing data. So some experience with MATLAB/Python or an equivalent programming language is required. Some background in neuroscience (at least 1 course) is also required as we will assume basic knowledge.",

Are the goals and questions of social science different from that of science and the humanities? How so? What sort of knowledge does social science try to establish? What kinds of methods does it employ? What sorts of disputes persist within the social sciences? What similarities and divisions exist among social scientific fields and why? This course is a graduate level seminar where students are asked to read challenging texts, discuss them, and offer constructive critiques in writing.

        "description": "(Same as LAW 7076) In recent years, selective universities have become more academically selective than ever. During the past half century their applicant pools have grown considerably--now including women, minorities, immigrants, and international students--while the sizes of their student bodies remain virtually unchanged. The broader social and economic context has shifted as well. With globalization, the advance of technology and the resulting labor market shifts, advanced education is seen as more important than ever to getting ahead. Yet, even as elite universities seem central to Americans' hopes and dream, they have also come under attack, viewed as disconnected from, and alien to, &quot;regular Americans.&quot; This course will engage these developments through considering a pivotal question: How do and should elite educational institutions choose among the many applicants vying for admission? Two principles loom large in the ethos of selective college admissions: diversity and merit. Throughout the course, we will take a critical stance toward these claims. For example, how much does and should merit shape admissions decisions? What are the rationales for using prior grades and test scores to assess applicants? Similarly, what are the costs and benefit of the diversity rationale? Should schools take account of race, socioeconomic class, or neither? Course readings will include judicial opinions and legal commentary, social science evidence and cultural criticism.

What happens when we begin with the concept that life is valuable and that concept should be the center of society when building institutions and responding to harm? In this short course, we will explore how abolition has been conceptualized over time, particularly in relation to carceral logics, and how both relate to education. We will explore what educators can learn from community-driven abolitionist projects and how we can apply these conceptualizations and strategies to education spaces towards liberation.",
