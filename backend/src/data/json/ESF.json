        "title": "Education as Self-Fashioning: How to Become a Global Citizen?",
        "description": "The concept of a liberal arts education was first developed in eighteenth-century Prussia by Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767-1835) and soon adopted by other countries, including the United States. Humboldt considered a liberal arts education to be both a foundational and transformative process in the development of the self, and he was convinced that it was essential in creating moral and ethical citizens in an increasingly global world. From his point of view, the cultivation of oneself leads to the freedom of thought, freedom to act, freedom to assert oneself as an individual, freedom to access knowledge, and freedom to determine one's own role in society. In this course we will explore Humboldt's concept of education and examine the ways in which it is reflected and refracted in debates about university education still today. This course satisfies the Aesthetic and Interpretive Inquiry WAY (AII).",

        "description": "This course considers education not as training in external knowledge or skills but as a lifelong process of development and growth in which an individual cultivates her or his spiritual, cultural and social sensibilities. This concept of education - education as a formative and transformative process in the development of the self - is called Bildung in German and has a long tradition reaching back to the Middle Ages. The term first appears in the writings of the mystic Meister Eckhart who defines it as self-composure which he regards as a crucial stage in our spiritual development. The concept of Bildung takes on a secular meaning in the Reformation, when Ulrich von Hutten first coined the phrase that has become Stanford's motto: &quot;Die Luft der Freiheit weht&quot;. (The wind of freedom is blowing). What he meant is that the cultivation of oneself leads to the freedom of thought, freedom to act, freedom to assert oneself as an individual, freedom to access knowledge, and freedom to determine one's own role in society. This idea of education as an internal and transformative process is central to debates in the nineteenth century (both in Germany and the United States) in which self-reflection is seen as key to the cultivation of an individual's identity and to her or his role as a member of society. In this course we will read reflections on education as self-fashioning by some of the greatest German thinkers spanning from the Middle Ages to the present. We will also enjoy some contemporary parodies of such reflections. These readings and our discussions will help us to understand Stanford undergraduate education as a transformative process of self-realization in our global society.",

In hindsight it is easy to see this potential negative impact, yet at the time the decision was made the EU leadership was blind to it. Not all unintended consequences are negative. Aspirin, for example, was developed to relieve pain, but was found to also be an anticoagulant that can lower the risk of heart attacks.

        "description": "In Greek tragedies, a horrific catastrophe falls upon a person and brings on extreme suffering.  For the Greeks, tragic plays offered the truth about life's calamities and horrors.  The Greeks enjoyed these plays because the dramatic artistry made beauty out of horror and suffering.  The Greeks did not believe that they controlled their fates.  The Greeks had a &quot;tragic wisdom&quot; that enabled them to confront the hardships of life and the inevitability of death.  This helped them to develop courage and resilience.  Plato attacked this view and introduced a new kind of hero, the philosopher Socrates.  As Plato claimed, we can control our fates by practicing philosophy:  this enables us to become wise and ethically good.  The philosopher strives for this goodness, which is beautiful in the highest possible way--it is our soul's true desire.  Our inner goodness is under our control, so the good and wise person will stay happy even when calamities strike.  Plato's optimistic philosophy flew in the face of Greek tragic wisdom.  Plato offered a new way of living, one based on higher education, the development of knowledge, and the pursuit of true beauty and goodness.  Do we believe that liberal education improves us ethically?  Do we feel optimistic or pessimistic about life?  To what extent can we control our lives and fates?  How do tragic plays, movies, or TV shows represent the horrors that happen in the real world?  Does the art that makes them beautiful and pleasurable help us to confront these horrors?  Who are our heroes?  What actions or qualities make them heroic?  We read six tragedies by Sophocles and Euripides, and three Platonic dialogues (Apology, Symposium, Republic).  We also read Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, which sets forth the opposition between Greek &quot;tragic wisdom&quot; and Plato's &quot;philosophic knowledge.&quot;",

When you applied to Stanford, you answered many application questions designed to elicit evidence of your ability to serve others, which is considered a sign of good character, leadership, and ability to thrive beyond the confines of your family and private world. Knowing you've wrestled with this question at length, showing sacrifice, endurance, empathy, and understanding of higher goods, this course asks you to examine the nation's view. How can the nation present itself as worthy of your personal sacrifice? Do you need to believe in the greatness of your nation to serve? What kind of cause demands your devotion? Nations have differently articulated such a commitment. Some make modest demands and promise you your own sovereignty. Others request only that you dream of national greatness as your own and that you lend a hand. But all nations require at some point, everything from you. What and when are you prepared to give?

In recent years, the Rhodes Must Fall movement in South Africa has spurred on a vibrant and difficult discussion across the world, about the legacy of colonialism in the modern university. Students and academics have been engaged in devising methods to understand and undo this colonial inheritance and confront the various connected structures of power such as hetero-patriarchy, racism, and class. One aspect of this endeavor has been to delve deep into the intellectual resources developed by anti-colonial and decolonial writers, revolutionaries, academics, and activists from the postcolonial world. This course is designed as a deep engagement with this critical decolonial work by some of the most significant thinkers from the Global South in the last hundred years. We will begin the course by developing a basic understanding of the contemporary call for decolonizing the university and the field of postcolonial and decolonial scholarship. After this, the main focus of this course will be a close reading and reflection on the writings that today constitute a rich reservoir of ideas for contemporary struggles to decolonize, to think critically about structures of power and injustice and to search for languages of liberation.",

These first generations of scientists both had to learn from each other and make it up as they went along. Humboldt's travels from 1799-1804 were an inspiration for Darwin's travels in the 1830s. Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle inspired Wallace and Bates to go to the Amazon a generation later. None of them were far removed from being students themselves: Darwin, Wallace, and Bates were all in their early 20s when starting out and Humboldt was an old man of 29. Their writings capture the excitement of their youth, their scientific idealism, and the breadth and depth of their interest in the natural world. We can explore the history of the science and the modern updating of that science. There is also taking advantage of being exposed to new horizons, the importance of a rigorous curiosity in life, the recognition of unique opportunity. A newly emerging framework of geologic time allowed understanding of evolutionary processes but only in conjunction with the possibility of global travel and experience of both temperate and tropical biotas-travel dependent on the colonial infrastructure built up by Spain and Portugal over the previous centuries and unraveling in the early 1800s. The travel writings capture young scientists working out the founding of their own scientific disciplines and the sacrifices and dedication that required, all in the context of a time when unique new connections could first have been made. The writings of these young scientists also capture the costs, both environmental and human, underlying their educational opportunities. We will have a chance to consider the blind spots among those that considered themselves unbiased scientific observers, the unintended consequences, and their roles and culpabilities within the colonial systems that made their work possible. The infrastructural capacity to observe tropical forests unavoidably also meant the degradation of those environments. Loss can be seen over the course of individual travel books and has only accelerated since one of Wallace's most remote locales is now an amusement water park, complete with YouTube videos.",
