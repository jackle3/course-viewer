        "title": "\"My Life Had Stood - A Loaded Gun\":  Dostoevsky, Dickinson, and the Question of Freedom.",
        "description": "As far apart as Dickinson and Dostoevsky are in terms of national contexts, gendered possibilities of life, and their choice of minimalist or maximalist forms, their experiences of constriction and freedom bore significant similarities. Dostoevsky penned his vow to love life on the day that he was manacled as a political prisoner and marched off to thirteen years of forced labor and exile in Siberia. He exploded back on the Petersburg literary scene in the early 1860's with three block-busters, &lt;em&gt;Notes from the Underground&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Memoirs from the House of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Crime and Punishment&lt;/em&gt;, establishing himself forever as Russia's most controversial explorer of the violence of human thought. In these same years Emily Dickinson was sequestering herself in her family's Amherst house for the remainder of her life, yet she announced her rebel's credo in these enigmatic lines: &lt;em&gt;&quot;My Life Had Stood, a Loaded Gun&lt;/em&gt; - until the Day...&quot; In this class we will explore the idea that Emily Dickinson and Fyodor Dostoevsky may be seen as original shifters of modern literary art and philosophy. We will unpack the agonizing relationship of freedom, action, and language that both authors explore. Classes will be organized around presentations, debates in pairs, the exploration of &quot;scandalous scenes,&quot; and finally a symposium in which students will present and contribute to each other's paper projects. There are no prerequisites for this course apart from a desire to read poems and novels closely and in tandem.",

        "description": "Why have verbal artists since Homer been fascinated with armed conflict and destruction? In the early 1990s, two self-consciously multinational and multicultural socialist states, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, broke apart. Soon, people who had lived in countries that proclaimed slogans like &quot;friendship of the peoples&quot; and &quot;brotherhood and unity&quot; were fighting wars with one another, incited by militant nationalism and dreams of conquest. Writers played an important role in these conflicts, usually not as frontline combatants (though it was a former poet who led the genocide in Bosnia) but rather because literature was called upon to explain the failures of the past and disasters of the present, to build up national identities that were newly autonomous yet under attack, or even to recreate a sense of multinational solidarity. In this class we will read literature connected to two wars in which smaller states have faced the violent designs of their more powerful neighbors: the invasion of Bosnia by Serbia (and Croatia) in the mid-1990s, and the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia. Readings will include works by Miljenko Jergovi, Dubravka Ugrei, Saa Stanii, Serhiy Zhadan, and Andrey Kurkov, in English translation.",

        "description": "The turn of the 20th century was marked with turbulent political events and heated discussions about the future of Russian and American societies. Many writers and intellectuals responded to the burning issues of social justice, inequality, egalitarianism, and exploitation associated with capitalism and socialism. Through close reading, critical thinking, and analytical writing, we will engage in the critical discussions of class struggle, individual interest versus collective values, race, and social equality, and identify points of convergence and divergence between the two systems. To what extent was the opposition between capitalism and socialism fueled by the artistic vision of the great Russian and American writers? What was these thinkers' ideal of society and what impact did it have on shaping emerging socialism? Readings for the class include the fundamental works of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Jack London, W.E.B. Du Bois and Sholem Aleichem. The course will culminate in a digital mapping project visualizing intellectual connections between ideas and writers.",

Our investigation will be based on close reading of the works written in various stages of Gogol's literary career. This study provides a perspective on the relationship between Romanticism and Realism in Russian literature, and between the popular Ukrainian culture and &quot;high&quot; Russian and West European traditions in Gogol's oeuvre. In the course, we will discuss such important theoretical concepts as the relation of narrator and author in a work, the methods of depicting characters, the differences between humor and satire, the notions of 'reality' and fantastic' in Gogol's world. The seminar also traces Gogol's influences on subsequent Russian literature (Dostoevsky in particular) and explores the impact of his work on XX century modernist literature, theatre, music, and painting (literature of the absurd, Dmitry Shostakovich, Vladimir Nabokov, Marc Chagall and Kazimir Malevich). The course is intended for the students interested in literature and literary theory.",

While agriculture is ancient and world-wide, literature and political movements that posited it as a way for urbanites to be happier and more virtuous and societies to reach utopia thrived especially in the 19th-century Russian Empire. These movements influenced Soviet Communism, nationalisms (including Zionism), and American communes in the 1970s. In this class, we read fiction, poetry, memoirs, and essays about city people's embrace of farming. We compare the Eastern European case to the United States in the 20th century and we look at 21st-century back-to-the-land writing and films. This class is offered in partnership with the Stanford Farm, where we will spend a few days working (assuming pandemic restrictions permit).",

We read essays by Jacob Grimm, Roman Jakobson, Vladimir Propp, Lenore Keeshig-Tobias, and others, to understand what folklore can mean and how the oral and the recorded word can interact. Students collect living folklore from a group of their choosing and analyze it using the theories we study in class (or other theories, if you want); wherever you are, you will tailor your research to the communities to which you have access.

How can Ukraine become an agent of democracy, stability, and unity? What does Ukraine's case of multiple identities and loyalties offer to our understanding of the global crisis of national identity? In this course, we will consider the historical permeability of Ukraine's territorial, cultural, and ethnic borders as an opportunity to explore the multiple dimensions of its relations with its neighbors. In addition to studying historical,  literary, and cinematic texts, we discuss nationalism, global capitalism, memory politics, and propaganda in order to understand post-Euromaidan society.

Through firsthand visual analysis of the picture presses of yesteryear, this course considers the ongoing meaning, circulation, and power of images as they shape a worldview in Russia as well as the US. In looking at points of contact between two world powers, we will cover the works of a wide array of authors, photographers, photojournalists and photographed celebrities (Lev Tolstoy, Margaret Bourke-White, Russian satirists Ilf and Petrov, John Steinbeck and Richard Capa, and many others). We will explore the relationship between photojournalistic practice of the past with that of our present, from the printed page to digital media, as well as the ethical quandaries posed by the cameras intervention into/shaping of modern history.

The material of the course helps better understand the different stages in the history of Russian literature.

There are few other regions where so many ethnicities, languages, and religions exist side by side -- or even closer than that  -- with one another.  It is also a region carved and re-carved into subject pieces by empires: Ottoman, Habsburg and Russian before World War I, violently torn between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during World War II, and forcibly coerced into a Bloc until the last decade of the 20th century.  Polish poet and Nobel laureate Czeslaw Milosz asserted that &quot;the most striking feature in Central European literature is its awareness of history&quot;: of history's somehow coexistent inexorability and caprice, and of its capacity for a full spectrum of absurdity, from tragic to banal to comic. This course will introduce works in translation by 20th- and 21st-century East Central European writers (Tokarczuk, Ugresic, Kassabova, Knezevic, and others) -- supplemented with selections from film, visual art, and music -- and consider how these creative works respond to the complexities of the region&iquest;s history, cultural diversity, and individual and collective identities.",

        "description": "Unless you subscribe to certain extreme life philosophies, animals probably constitute some of your existence and environment - whether living with pets, hearing birds around campus, or confronting our human selves every morning, most of us would struggle to completely avoid animals in daily life. In this course, we explore different types of media and texts - though predominantly Russian and Yiddish literatures from 19th-century Russia in English translation - ventriloquizing, problematizing, and otherwise instrumentalizing non-human animals. Through our animal readings on narration and theory, we reconsider concepts of relation, humanism, sustainability, responsibility. Students can apply their refined understandings to create art pieces of digital humanities projects using the Textile Makerspace.",

It went through devastating floods and a deadly siege; it birthed the &quot;Petersburg myth,&quot; poems and prose that explore the force of the state and the individual's ability to resist. This class addresses the struggle between the authorities and the inhabitants; the treacherous natural environment; the city as a node in national and international networks of communication; the development of urban transportation networks; and the supply of goods. NOTE: <i>This course is required of students attending the overseas seminar to St. Petersburg in September 2018.</i>Class times to be determined upon the availability of all enrolled students.

        "description": "Historically shaped by shifting borders and mixing of various cultures and languages, identities in-between have been in abundance in Central-Eastern Europe. This course offers a comprehensive study of the oeuvre of several major Central-European authors of modernity: the Ukrainian-Russian Nikolai Gogol (1809-1852), the Czech-German-Jewish Franz Kafka (1883-1924), the Austrian-Galician-Jewish Leopold von Sacher-Masoch (1836-1895), the Ukrainian-Galician Olha Kobylyans&iquest;ka (1863-1942), the Russian-German Lou Andreas-Salom&eacute; (1861-1937), the Jewish-Polish-Galician Bruno Schulz (1892-1942), and the Polish-Argentinean Witold Gombrowicz (1904-1969). Performing their selves in two or more cultures, these writers were engaged in identity games and produced hybrid texts with which they intervened into the major culture as others. In the course, we will apply post-structuralist and post-colonial concepts such as minor language, heterotopia, in-betweenness, mimicry, indeterminacy, exile, displacement, and transnationalism to the study of the writers oeuvres. We will also master the sociolinguistic analysis of such multi-lingual phenomena as self-translation, code-switching, and calquing and examine various versions of the same text to uncover the palimpsest of hybrid identities.",

During the course, we will study environmental, social, and ecological consequences of the Chernobyl disaster and analyze its many representations across a range of media and cultures. In the end of the course, we will create a portrait of Chernobyl in the collaborative multimedia project &quot;The Control Room #4&quot; which will assemble the representation of Chernobyl in fictional, cinematographic, oral histories, map projects, VR, photography, and other media in order to show how the disaster resonates across space and time. We will consider such issues as urban and technological utopias of the late Soviet Union, representations of the disaster; ethics; health and disease; the body and its deconstruction; ecology and climate; the appropriation of disaster narratives and disaster tourism; the media and cover-ups; and faith and religion.",

In our look at a wide variety of children's cultural artifacts (from text to film), we will analyze the ways in which stories for children, and stories about children, form the foundation for literacy and cultural education. We will be transported by the magic of fairy tales as we compare the Brothers Grimm to Russian folk tales. We will analyze pedagogical and artistic methods in illustrated primers, picture books, and magazines made for American and Soviet youth. We will examine the media and politics that shape the adaptation of oral storytelling to the animation of the silver screen. Through these and many other sites of comparison between Russia, Eastern Europe and world traditions, we seek to understand the specific cultural codes of childhood in its historical development, as well as what might constitute a universal notion of being a child.

The first section examines literature from Kyivan Rus' (up to the thirteenth century), the medieval conglomerate to which Belarus, Russia and Ukraine all trace their cultural heritage. The second section examines old Russian literature specifically, from the fourteenth to seventeenth centuries. We pay close attention to the development of literary genres, moral/religious and aesthetic features and their relationship, and the beginnings of Russian belles lettres. Our approach to the texts will be two-fold. On the one hand, we will spend some time situating the sources within their historical contexts. On the other hand, we will explore the interpretive possibilities of premodern literature using formal analysis and critical theory. Knowledge of an East Slavic language is required.",

We'll also ask whether a disenchanted world can be re-enchanted; when, if ever, the truth stops being the most important thing; why we sometimes choose to read sad stories; whether we ever love someone for who they are; who could possibly want to live their same life over and over again; what it takes to make ourselves fully moral; whether it's ever good to be conflicted; how we can pull ourselves together; and how we can take ourselves apart.

It will explore how the state and non-state actors such as media, businesses, churches and NGOs have molded citizens' ethnonational, linguo-cultural, social, local/regional, and other identities. At the heart of analysis will be the politics of language and their relation to ethnonational identity and power relations, the former prioritizing Ukrainian and the latter often giving advantage to Russian. At the same time, the course will also examine the politics of ethnicity, citizenship, memory, religion, and foreign policy. We will discuss legislation, political statements, media materials, protest campaign slogans, urban landscape tokens, and other textual and visual representations of certain policies asserting certain identities. We will learn how these practices constructed Ukraine as different from Russia and how the latter's attempt to impose - politically, culturally, and militarily &iquest; the similarity of the two peoples ultimately led Ukrainians to embrace a more radically anti-Russian identity.",

While emphasizing the Formalists (Shklovsky, Tynianov, Eikhenbaum, Jakobson) and the Bakhtin circle (Bakhtin, Voloshinov), we will also read their predecessors (Potebnia, Humboldt, Veselovsky) and later thinkers inspired by them (Lydia Ginzburg, Yuri Lotman) as well as their contemporary interlocutors who shaped structuralist and Marxist schools of theory (Jan Mukaovsky, Georg Luk&aacute;cs). Key issues will include the concept of literary or poetic language, the definition of &quot;form&quot; and its relationship with &quot;content,&quot; the extent of literature's autonomy with respect to historical developments and social forces, the importance of genre, and the nature of literary scholarship. Theoretical texts will be closely read. Knowledge of Russian or another Slavic language is helpful but not required: readings will be offered in English translation.",

The course will relate fiction to the specific culture and politics in both countries, while also drawing transnational connections. We ask why writers and readers, filmmakers and viewers loved this art so much, despite living in what seemed to be very different places. Soviet and Eastern-European writers and filmmakers will include Mikhail Bulgakov, Stanis&iquest;aw Lem, and Andrei Tarkovsky. The Americans may include Kurt Vonnegut, Philip K.

It was this ceaseless pursuit of another word that allowed Bakhtin, one of the most distinguished literary critics of the twentieth century, to author several influential literary theory concepts, many of which deal with the ideas of multiplicity, diversity and unfinalizability. The seminar explores these core concepts through close reading of key texts in English and investigates their reverberations in the writings of other thinkers such as Kristeva, de Man and Derrida",

        "description": "Russia is huge and linguistically and religiously diverse. Yet the ideology of nationalism --the idea that culturally unified groups should rule their own territories-- took root in Russia in the early 19th century and is powerful today. What made this happen? Political thinkers, writers, and other artists have argued for the superiority of the Russian nation. Meanwhile, the tsarist, Soviet, and post-Soviet governments have worked to reconcile the ideology of nationalism with the realities of the administration of a diverse state. This course examines the roots of nationalism itself and the paradox of Russian nationalism, looking at literary and political writers including Dostoevsky, Stalin, and Solzhenitsyn.",

We will also consider the impact of their films on democratization of Soviet society. In the second half of the quarter students examine the themes and trends of the Ukrainian cinema from 1991 to the present day, as they resonate in the films of Valentyn Vasyanovych, Sergei Loznitsa, Antonio Lukich, Dmitry Tomashpolsky, and Nadiya Parfan and discuss the relationship between cinematography and society in times of crisis. We will consider how changes in priorities and values in Ukrainian society resulting from the current conflict have affected the repertoire of Ukrainian theaters, particularly that of the Lesya Ukrainka Theater (formerly the Russian Drama Theatre), Theater-on-Podil, and the Ivan Franko National Theatre.",

Drawing on examples from Putin's Russia and post-Soviet Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan will develop methodologies for studying how state power is undermined &quot;from below&quot; by ordinary citizens seeking to shape politics and policy. We will take protests seriously as events; consider interactions between protest participants and the social spaces in which protests take place; and situate events with respect to ordinary moments of cultural and political life. The course is structured around active student discussion with a few supplementary lectures and zoom interviews with political activists and artists in exile.

        "description": "Russia is huge and linguistically and religiously diverse. Yet the ideology of nationalism --the idea that culturally unified groups should rule their own territories-- took root in Russia in the early 19th century and is powerful today. What made this happen? Political thinkers, writers, and other artists have argued for the superiority of the Russian nation. Meanwhile, the tsarist, Soviet, and post-Soviet governments have worked to reconcile the ideology of nationalism with the realities of the administration of a diverse state. This course examines the roots of nationalism itself and the paradox of Russian nationalism, looking at literary and political writers including Dostoevsky, Stalin, and Solzhenitsyn.",

The practical goal of the course is to acquaint the students with specific features of Russian prosody and verse in its historical development and to survey such basic concepts as meter and rhythm, iamb and trochee, ternary meters and dolniks, accentual verse and free verse, rhyme and stanza in order to grasp their difference within Russian poetry from what we encounter in ancient Greek and Latin, as well as modern European literatures. The material of the course helps better understand the different stages in the history of Russian literature. We also address various approaches to poetry translation and the use of oriental verse forms (Persian, Japanese etc.) in Russian modern and modernist literature.

With a particular focus on Russian and East European objects (including those by Russian icons, Soviet posters, and prints by Wassily Kandinsky and Marc Chagall), the course will include a basic introduction to color terminology, guest lectures on the technologies color printing, the science of color perception, and a hands-on practicum in color mixing/pigmentation.

The 'memory boom' in post-1991 Russia and Easter Europe has significantly altered the way the post-socialist subjects remember, forget, or imagine their Soviet legacy. The course proposes a critical appraisal of memory studies as an opportunity for engaging in a genuine interdisciplinary endeavor. It starts by defining the field of research at the intersection of history, anthropology, sociology, and cultural theory and examines the emergence of 'memory' as an object of study within these disciplines. In the second part of the course, we will study literary representation of memory and forgetting through the concepts of post-memory, second-generation memory, memory of eye-witnesses and perpetrators, memory of the displaced persons, and amnesia and memory loss fiction. And finally, we will engage in comparing the social practices of selective remembering and forgetting of the memory of the WWII and Soviet legacy in present-day Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus.",

        "description": "East Central Europe, both despite and because of its history of shape-shifting borders, has long been the locus of extraordinarily diverse humanity.  There are few other regions where so many ethnicities, languages, and religions exist side by side -- or even closer than that  -- with one another.  It is also a region carved and re-carved into subject pieces by empires: Ottoman, Habsburg and Russian before World War I, violently torn between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during World War II, and forcibly coerced into a Bloc until the last decade of the 20th century.  Polish poet and Nobel laureate Czeslaw Milosz asserted that &quot;the most striking feature in Central European literature is its awareness of history&quot;: of history's somehow coexistent inexorability and caprice, and of its capacity for a full spectrum of absurdity, from tragic to banal to comic. This course will introduce works in translation by 20th- and 21st-century East Central European writers (Tokarczuk, Ugresic, Kassabova, Knezevic, and others) -- supplemented with selections from film, visual art, and music -- and consider how these creative works respond to the complexities of the region&iquest;s history, cultural diversity, and individual and collective identities.",

        "description": "Historically shaped by shifting borders and mixing of various cultures and languages, identities in-between have been in abundance in Central-Eastern Europe. This course offers a comprehensive study of the oeuvre of several major Central-European authors of modernity: the Ukrainian-Russian Nikolai Gogol (1809-1852), the Czech-German-Jewish Franz Kafka (1883-1924), the Austrian-Galician-Jewish Leopold von Sacher-Masoch (1836-1895), the Ukrainian-Galician Olha Kobylyans&iquest;ka (1863-1942), the Russian-German Lou Andreas-Salom&eacute; (1861-1937), the Jewish-Polish-Galician Bruno Schulz (1892-1942), and the Polish-Argentinean Witold Gombrowicz (1904-1969). Performing their selves in two or more cultures, these writers were engaged in identity games and produced hybrid texts with which they intervened into the major culture as others. In the course, we will apply post-structuralist and post-colonial concepts such as minor language, heterotopia, in-betweenness, mimicry, indeterminacy, exile, displacement, and transnationalism to the study of the writers oeuvres. We will also master the sociolinguistic analysis of such multi-lingual phenomena as self-translation, code-switching, and calquing and examine various versions of the same text to uncover the palimpsest of hybrid identities.",

In the end of the course, we will create a portrait of Chernobyl in the collaborative multimedia project &quot;The Control Room #4&quot; which will assemble the representation of Chernobyl in fictional, cinematographic, oral histories, map projects, VR, photography, and other media in order to show how the disaster resonates across space and time. We will consider such issues as urban and technological utopias of the late Soviet Union, representations of the disaster; ethics; health and disease; the body and its deconstruction; ecology and climate; the appropriation of disaster narratives and disaster tourism; the media and cover-ups; and faith and religion.",

In our look at a wide variety of children's cultural artifacts (from text to film), we will analyze the ways in which stories for children, and stories about children, form the foundation for literacy and cultural education. We will be transported by the magic of fairy tales as we compare the Brothers Grimm to Russian folk tales. We will analyze pedagogical and artistic methods in illustrated primers, picture books, and magazines made for American and Soviet youth. We will examine the media and politics that shape the adaptation of oral storytelling to the animation of the silver screen. Through these and many other sites of comparison between Russia, Eastern Europe and world traditions, we seek to understand the specific cultural codes of childhood in its historical development, as well as what might constitute a universal notion of being a child.

The first section examines literature from Kyivan Rus' (up to the thirteenth century), the medieval conglomerate to which Belarus, Russia and Ukraine all trace their cultural heritage. The second section examines old Russian literature specifically, from the fourteenth to seventeenth centuries. We pay close attention to the development of literary genres, moral/religious and aesthetic features and their relationship, and the beginnings of Russian belles lettres. Our approach to the texts will be two-fold. On the one hand, we will spend some time situating the sources within their historical contexts. On the other hand, we will explore the interpretive possibilities of premodern literature using formal analysis and critical theory. Knowledge of an East Slavic language is required.",
