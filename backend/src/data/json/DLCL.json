        "description": "This course will journey through ancient Greek and Roman literature from Homer to St. Augustine, in constant conversation with the other HumCore travelers in the Ancient Middle East, Africa and South Asia, and Early China. It will introduce participants to some of its fascinating features and big ideas (such as the idea of history); and it will reflect on questions including: What is an honorable life? Who is the Other? How does a society fall apart? Where does human subjectivity fit into a world of matter, cause and effect? Should art serve an exterior purpose? Do we have any duties to the past? This course is part of the Humanities Core, a collaborative set of global humanities seminars that brings all of its students and faculty into conversation. On Mondays you meet in your own course, and on Wednesdays all the HumCore seminars (in session that quarter) meet together: https://humanitiescore.stanford.edu/.",

While exploring each place in a particular historical moment, we will also consider the relations between culture, power, and social life. How does the cultural life of a country intersect with the political activity of a capital? How do large cities shape our everyday experience, our aesthetic preferences, and our sense of history? Why do some cities become cultural capitals? Primary materials for this course will consist of literary, visual, sociological, and historical documents (in translation); authors we will read include Boccaccio, Dante, Sor Juana, Montesquieu, Baudelaire, Gogol, Irmgard Keun, Freud, and Borges.

We shall consider the training and physical efforts of scribes, and the transmission of knowledge, including that of traditionally oral cultures.

As a foundations class, this survey of medieval culture engages in particular the art and architecture of the period.

We will study a large geographical area encompassing the British Isles, Europe, the Mediterranean, Central Asia, India, and East Africa and trace the connectivity of these lands in economic, political, religious, and artistic terms from the fourth to the fourteenth century C.E. The students will have two lectures and one discussion session per week. Depending on the size of the class, it is possible that a graduate student TA will run the discussion session.

If you work with text (literature, historical documents, fanfic, tweets, or any other textual material) in languages other than English, DLCL 204 is for you. No previous programming or other technical experience is required, just a reading knowledge of a language other than English (modern or historical).

In his work he engaged with avantgarde poets like Paul &Eacute;luard, Antonin Artaud and Tristan Tzara, the post-colonial philosopher and psychiatrist Frantz Fanon and philosopher F&eacute;lix Guattari. His project was shaped by radical politics in Catalonia during the 1930s and his own practice of treating the therapeutic community rather than the patients themselves. Tosquelles worked with people outside the medical profession: musicians, writers, lawyers and even prostitutes. These experiences resonate in the book he wrote on poet Gabriel Ferrater and the Spanish Civil War. Taught in English.",

The latter can take place during plenary, over office hours with faculty coordinators, or via contributions to the focal group's online platforms. A short quarterly response paper that relates group discussions with the student's ongoing research is recommended. May be repeated for credit.",

        "description": "The Focal Group in Philosophy and Literature brings together scholars and students from eight departments to investigate questions in aesthetics and literary theory, philosophically-inflected literary texts, and the form of philosophical writings. Fields of interest include both continental and analytic philosophy, as well as cognitive science, political philosophy, rational choice theory, and related fields. Students may sign up for a unit of credit each quarter via DLCL 222. To earn the unit, students must secure written permission in advance from one of the instructors, before the final study list deadline. They must then do one of the following three things: (a) attend an event hosted by the Philosophy and Literature group (including events hosted by the graduate workshop) and write up a reaction paper of 2-5 pages; (b) present a paper of their own to the graduate workshop; (c) agree with one of the DLCL 222 instructors on a reading related to the year's activities, and meet with him/her for a discussion of that reading. Normally, students should register for the CR/NC option; only students planning to use DLCL 222 for the Ph.D. minor in Philosophy and Literature should enroll for a letter grade. Prerequisite for undergraduates: undergraduate students wishing to take DLCL 222 must previously have taken the philosophy and literature gateway course PHIL 81 ( CLASSICS 42, COMPLIT 181, ENGLISH 81, FRENCH 181, GERMAN 181, ITALIAN 181, SLAVIC 181) or a class taught by one of the instructors of DLCL 222.",

        "description": "The Workshop in Poetics is concerned with the theoretical and practical dimensions of the reading and criticism of poetry. During the many years of its existence, the Workshop has become a central venue at Stanford enabling participants to share their individual projects in a general conversation outside of disciplinary and national confinements. The two dimensions that the workshop sees as urgent are: poetics in its specificity as an arena for theory and interpretive practice, and historical poetics as a particular set of challenges for the reader and scholar.",

        "description": "This course serves as the Core Seminar for the PhD Minor in Philosophy, Literature, and the Arts. It introduces students to a wide range of topics at the intersection of philosophy with literary and arts criticism. The seminar is intended for graduate students. It is suitable for theoretically ambitious students of literature and the arts, philosophers with interests in value theory, aesthetics, and topics in language and mind, and other students with strong interest in the psychological importance of engagement with the arts. In this year's installment, we will focus on issues about the nature of fiction, about the experience of appreciation and what it does for us, about the ethical consequences of imaginative fictions, and about different conceptions of the importance of the arts in life more broadly.

        "title": "DLCL Film Series: Rebel With a Cause",
        "description": "This quarter's film series will examine the representation of resistance, rebellion, and revolt in international cinema. Starting with Michael Almereyda's biographical drama Experimenter (2015), we will examine Stanley Milgram's studies on complicity, conformity, and resistance in his famous experiments on following instructions to inflict pain. From there we will move to canonical cinematic representations of acts of resistance like Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's The Lives of Others (2006), Jean-Pierre Melville's Army of Shadows (1969), and Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin (1925) to discuss why these films have been canonized as some of the most suspenseful and powerful films of all time. Viewing Marcel Carn&eacute;'s Children of Paradise (1945), filmed during the Nazi Occupation of France, and Victor Erice's The Spirit of the Beehive (1973), filmed during the Franco regime in Spain, will allow us to discuss the ways that cinema itself is used as a tool of resistance. And discussing Walter Salles' Motorcycle Diaries (2004), Francisco Vargas' The Violin (2005), and Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds (2009) will allow us to explore the ways that resistance in diverse forms from unexpected actors can lead to movements that may or may not change the world. Discussion will focus on analyzing the structures, actors, and acts of resistance, rebellion, and revolt in international film. In particular we will look at who resists and why; how a rebel's identity and social position affects his or her political engagement; and how different forms of resistance can create movements that evolve from grassroots, across governments, and around the globe. In our study of representations of resistance across different schools and cultures of cinema, film technologies, and cinematic history, we will also address the ways that film creates suspense and intrigue, represents cause and effect, and prompts questions of ethics. Screening Schedule: April 4 Experimenter (2015) Michael Almereyda , April 11 Army of Shadows (1969) Jean-Pierre Melville, April 18 Children of Paradise (1946) Marcel Carn&eacute; , April 25 Battleship Potemkin (1925) Sergei Eisenstein, May 2 The Lives of Others (2006) Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, May 9 Motorcycle Diaries (2004) Walter Salles, May 16 The Violin (2005) Francisco Vargas, May 23 The Battle of Algiers (1966) Gillo Pontecorvo, June 6 The Spirit of the Beehive (1973) Victor Erice , and June 13 Inglourious Basterds (2009) Quentin Tarantino.",
