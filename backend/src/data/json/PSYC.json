        "description": "Sleep can be a window into much of our awake worlds- anxiety, depression, relationships, trauma, safety, early morning travel plans.. and so much more. If you think of a recent night in which you experienced worse sleep, you might be able to identify something from your awake world that contributed. Much of our awake world is informed by emotion, thoughts, and perception. One could argue that emotion, thoughts, and perception shape the world, rather than there being one true reality. This course will explore the fundamentals of sleep, the fundamentals of navigating emotions, and the intersection between the two. Specifically, you&iquest;ll learn the basics of human sleep science, the principles of a type of psychotherapy called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and how CBT tools can be applied to sleep difficulties.Break-out sessions within each lecture provide opportunities for students to ask questions and to discuss a topic in greater depth. The course will highlight the mind body connection and serve as an introduction to behavioral sleep medicine. Students will have the opportunity to complete their own project examining a sleep-wake connection of interest. Potential topics will be provided (discrimination and sleep, menstruation and sleep, high school start times, shift work and sleep, and more). As a sleep psychologist, I consider myself to be both a scientist and an artist. This course will be most interesting to those who are interested in emotions, therapeutic skills, and sleep.",

        "description": "Alcohol is the most commonly used substance of abuse across the world. In the United States, approximately 179 million individuals (65% of the population) drank alcohol in the past year. A relatively small, but highly significant portion of these individuals who drink ultimately reach criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Today, almost 15 million people in the U.S. struggle with an AUD. Many decades of research have sought to uncover the brain-based driving forces behind alcohol misuse, the consequences of alcohol on brain function and structure, and how we can effectively treat Alcohol Use Disorder. This course will first cover our current understanding of the brain circuits the drive alcohol craving, use and withdrawal. Then, we will explore alcohol&iquest;s effects on the brain throughout the lifespan, ranging from prenatal alcohol exposure, adolescence, young adults (including binge drinking in college), middle adulthood, and aging individuals at risk for cognitive decline. Lastly, this course will cover the state-of-the-art techniques being developed to help individuals achieve sobriety and recovery from Alcohol Use Disorder. This highly interactive seminar will engage and equips students with skills in critical thinking, evaluation of scientific research, and a deeper understanding of AUD as a brain-based disease. Students will have the opportunity to engage in thoughtful discussions with treatment providers and AUD patients to gain a deeper understanding of the realities behind AUD treatment. Overall, this course is intended to help students develop strong skills in thinking and reading like a scientist, understanding the complexities behind alcohol use and misuse across the lifespan, and considering the reality of today&iquest;s treatment landscape for Alcohol Use Disorder.",

        "description": "This course will explore the promise and limits of artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of human cognition. Amid whispers of robots one day taking over the world, it is tempting to imagine that AI is (or soon will be) all-powerful. But few of us understand how AI works, which may lead us to overestimate its current (and even its future) capabilities. As it turns out, intelligence is complicated to build, and while computers outperform humans in many ways, they also fail to replicate key features of human intelligence at least for now. We will take a conceptual, non-technical approach (think: reading essays, not writing code). Drawing upon readings from philosophy of science, computer science, and cognitive psychology, we will examine the organizing principles of AI versus human intelligence, and the capabilities and limitations that follow. Computers vastly outperform humans in tasks that require large amounts of computational power (for example, solving complex mathematical equations). However, you may be surprised to learn the ways in which humans outperform computers. What is it about the human brain that allows us to understand and appreciate humor, sarcasm, and art? How do we manage to drive a car without hitting pedestrians? Is it only a matter of time before computers catch up to these abilities? Or are there differences of kind (rather than degree) that distinguish human intelligence from AI? Will robots always be constrained to the tasks that humans program them to do? Or could they, one day, take over the world? By the end of this course, you will be able to discuss the current capabilities, future potential, and fundamental limitations of AI. You may also arrive at a newfound appreciation for human intelligence, and for the power of your own brain.",

By the end of this course, you will be able to decide for yourself, based on the latest scientific evidence. You will also be able to explain how your answer reflects, and informs, current research on mental health.  In this course, we will start by reading philosophical texts that establish the classical Western view of emotion and cognition as opposing forces. We will then put these views to the test by examining evidence from the fields of neuroscience, psychology, and psychiatry. When thoughts and feelings compete, which one wins? Is it ever rational to follow your emotions?  How do thoughts and feelings affect perception, memory, and decision-making? We will then turn to practical applications of cognitive-emotional interactions in the field of psychiatry. First, we will examine the implications of biases in perception, memory, and decision-making for mental health. Next, we will introduce cognitive profiles of specific psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, depression, and autism. We will also discuss clinical interventions that are informed by cognitive theories of psychiatric disorders, for example, cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people change how they feel by changing how they think. Finally, we will examine how the physical body influences thoughts and feelings, with implications for psychiatric disorders. What is the relationship of physical illness to psychiatric illness? Is sleep as good as overnight therapy? Is there a scientific basis for the notion that emotions originate from the heart? By the end of this course, you will be able to describe whether mental well-being arise from the head, the heart, or their interaction.",

        "title": "The Terrible Toll of Close Combat:  Fact and Myth from Xenophon to Fallujah to the X-Box",
        "description": "&quot;Close Combat&quot; is the direct, violent encounter of troops at short range.  Commanders, historians, and politicians may view grand elements of strategy, logistics or tactical maneuver to assess armed conflict.  But in close combat, soldiers on that &quot;thin red line&quot; face a rapidly narrowing set of possibilities as terrain, time and distance are focused to a point of brutal action.  Psychologically this is the vanishing point of legal, moral, and religious proscriptions that have guided life to that point where, it is said, the soldiers becomes &quot;transparent&quot;: all that one is or hoped or dreamt can be abruptly extinguished en toto.  In this course we will examine the sociobiological, medical, psychological, and legal aspects of close combat: including the systematic preconditioning of soldiers for killing, the fraternal social milieu of the small combat unit and the impact on survivors who need to deconstruct that conditioning and social bond. We will examine first-hand descriptions of close combat, through memoir, literature, congressional testimony, and guest speakers. The perspective will be that of the long history of youth facing the bleeding edge of battle and the recent ambiguous implications of &quot;remote&quot; and &quot;virtual&quot; combat. Course will include preparatory excerpted reading, short didactics, occasional guest speakers for half the sessions and group discussion of session topics / student presentations for the latter half.  The student will be expected to write a short paper on each of two topics from a list of prompts.",

        "description": "We live in a society that continues to deprioritize sleep by embracing the &quot;I'fll sleep when I'm dead&quot; mentality. But what actually happens to your brain when you miss a night of sleep? How does this then impact your ability to recall the test material you just spent all night cramming for? Why does missing a night of sleep make some people feel more irritable or anxious? Should high schools start later? What is considered a good night of sleep and how do we measure it? Through guided readings, lectures, and discussion, this seminar will critically examine the research that has attempted to address these important questions. Students will be introduced to the science of sleep with a particular focus on its role in memory, attention, emotion processing, and mood. We will also examine how the role of sleep in these vital functions may change across the lifespan, with a particular emphasis on adolescence. Readings will be primary scientific literature in biology, cognitive neuroscience, and psychology as well as some popular press coverage of these original scientific articles. As a result, students will learn how to read and interpret scientific articles and critically evaluate the popular press coverage of these articles in the context of sleep research. The class will culminate in a small group outreach project focused on communicating the importance of sleep with peers and the community.",

It is now possible to view your DNA in minute detail for only $99. Height, weight, educational attainment, depression risk, and much more, can be predicted using genetic information. Ethical questions abound regarding the use of genetic information in medicine, the legal system, government, and private companies. On the other hand, genetic findings may dramatically improve mental health treatment by guiding the development of new medications, matching patients to the right treatments, and identifying people for whom early mental health services might make all the difference. How much can you learn about risk for mental health problems from your DNA? This course will provide the foundational genetic and statistical information necessary for understanding the current and future capabilities of personal genomic predictions for mental health outcomes including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. We will also explore the ways in which genetic data can reveal where our ancestors lived as well as the consequences of a lack of diversity in genetic databases. This course also focuses on the practice of science, how it works well and how it can go terribly wrong. Learning from past examples of the misuse of genetic information, students will propose and debate strategies for maximizing the utility of genetic research to improve mental health while simultaneously limiting potential harms.",

        "description": "This course applies techniques learned in the Introductory Studies seminar: Psychology of Stoked (PSYC 60N) to promote student wellbeing during the 2020 COVID19 (coronavirus) pandemic. Spring Quarter 2020, the members of the Stoked Lab will explore the cultural, psychological, social, and biological aspects of what it means to live a positive, life-affirming existence. How does a worldwide pandemic change our possibilities for leading a balanced life with maximum happiness? To discover the answer, we will use a variety of sources; from philosophy to psychology, from literature, to spirituality, from biological sciences to the daily news. In parallel with the Introductory Studies seminar, students will use class content to develop media material using concepts developed in the class to promote wellbeing in this unusual time. This material will be shared with the greater Stanford undergraduate community as the 2020 Spring Quarter evolves during a global pandemic. PSYC 60N is a prerequisite for this course (which may benwaived by the instructor)",

        "description": "Over 900 million individuals worldwide suffer from a mental health disorder. Human and financial costs associated with the management of individuals with mental health disorder are substantial and constitute a growing public health challenge. Yet there are presently no objective markers used to determine which individuals have a mental health disorder and predict the progression of the disorder. Furthermore, there are presently a limited number of effective treatments for mental health disorders, as well as considerable heterogeneity in treatment response. The lack of access to mental health care is yet another challenge in developed as well as developing countries. Newly available technologies such as Artificial Intelligence offer an unprecedented opportunity for developing solutions that address the aforementioned challenges and problems. In this interdisciplinary seminar, students will learn about (i) psychopathology, (ii) state-of-the-art in diagnosis and treatments of mental health disorders, (iii) unaddressed challenges and problems related to mental health, (iv) artificial intelligence and its potential through real-world examples, (v) recent real-world applications of artificial intelligence that address the challenges and problems related to mental health, and (vi) ethical issues associated with the application of artificial intelligence to mental health. Diverse viewpoints and a deeper understanding of these topics will be offered by a mix of hands-on educational sessions and panel discussions with psychiatrists, computer scientists, lawyers, and entrepreneurs. Students will also spend guided time working in small teams to develop innovative (artificial intelligence based) solutions to challenges/problems related to mental health.",

This is particularly true of that state clinicians call &quot;psychosis.&quot; But psychosis is a complex concept. It can be terrifying and devastating for patients and families, and yet shares characteristics with other, less pathological states, such as mysticism and creativity. How then can we begin to make sense of it? In this course, we will examine the first-hand experience of psychosis.  We will approach it from multiple perspectives, including clinical descriptions, works of art, and texts by writers ranging from Shakespeare, to the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, to patients attempting to describe their experience. This class is not only for students thinking of careers in medicine, psychology or anthropology, but also readers and writers interested exploring extraordinary texts. There are no prerequisites necessary; all that is needed is a love of language and a curiosity about the secrets of other minds.",

The field of mental health is advancing the understanding of this disorder through research, education, innovation and policy guidance. This class aims to help students better understand the struggles of addiction in our world by discussing many components involved in the disease including: physiology, psychology, treatment options, and the societal implications of addiction.nnStudents will engage in thought-provoking between psychology, neuroscience, and society. They will develop the knowledge-base and framework to critically evaluate the science behind addiction and how to apply this knowledge to address the addiction epidemic in our world. As technology advances, many new types of addiction are emerging, creating an additional urgent need to discuss the implications this burgeoning problem. This highly interactive seminar aims to engage the students in critical thinking didactics, activities and discussions that shape their understanding of the complexity inherent to the issues surrounding addiction, and increase the student&iquest;s ability to more critically assimilate and interrogate information.",

Executive Order 13769, dubbed the &quot;Muslim Ban&quot;, suspended the entry of citizens from multiple Muslim-majority countries and banned the entry of Syrian refugees indefinitely. The &quot;Muslim Ban&quot; coincided with the highest level of hate crimes against Muslims in America (91% increase in 2017 per CAIR). These levels are comparable to post-9/11 levels of hate crimes. Decades of research on minority communities has documented how stress associated with stigma, intimidation and discrimination is detrimental to physical and mental health. In this seminar we will explore the historical implications of Islamophobia and its modern-day impact on the global refugee crisis. Students will be introduced to the stigma that surrounds mental health in general and minority communities in particular. Special attention will be paid to the development of the nascent field Islamic Psychology and integrating Islamic spirituality into therapy as a means of addressing the under utilization of mental health services in Muslim populations. A combination of stimulating group discussions, talks by guest speakers, and field trips to community partners will provide students with different perspectives and a deeper understanding of these topics.

        "description": "In this seminar we want to take a look at women's lives beginning in the past century to the present and the many changes which occurred in conceptualizing and understanding mental illness. The female reproductive system has been linked to mental illness in women for centuries. The womb was believed to be the source of anxiety and depression, leading women to become 'hysterical'. But what does 'hysteria' really mean, and how have historical and cultural attitudes towards women framed the study of women's mental health?  How have the expectations of and demands on women and their role in society changed from the 19th to the 20th century? How have advances in health care and changing economic conditions influenced women's health? The course will introduce students to historical and current concepts of mental illness in women. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMS), eating disorders, the hysterias and functional neurologic disorders and infertility and postpartum depression will be analyzed through a historical bio-psycho-social lens. Historical reading will include primary sources, such as women's diaries and physicians' casebooks and medical case records, as well as secondary sources such as advice books, and 19th- and 20th-century medical texts. Guest speakers from the art history and literature departments will stimulate dialogue regarding literary and artistic images and the social and cultural contexts of these disorders.  Importantly, we will examine the changing face of &quot;mental illness in women&quot; in art, literature and medicine--the evolution of diversity in represented voices and the current methods of researching and treating the interface between the female reproductive cycle and psychiatric illness in diverse populations of women.  Embedded within each lecture will be break-out sessions with opportunities for students to ask questions and to discuss a topic in greater depth.  Students will have the opportunity to complete their own interdisciplinary projects for the course.  Prior projects have included not only power point presentations of diverse topics, but also short films and stories, and future women's mental health research project proposals.",

Supported by findings in modern neuroscience and psychological research, yoga is an ancient, holistic modality that integrates body, mind, and community through ethical awareness, movement, breathing, and meditation. This integration lends itself to embodied, creative expression as wellas other healing modalities you will explore, such as theater and performance, dance, qigong, and laughter yoga. Yoga philosophy and postures are drawn from Dr. Christiane Brem's protocol developed as a therapeutic yoga class. The weekly performance exercises we will practice were developed by theater makers such as Augusto Boal and the UK-based performance duo Curious.",

        "description": "Machine learning has driven remarkable advances in many fields and, recently, it has been pivotal in enhancing the diagnosis and treatment of complex brain disorders. Biomedical and neuroscience studies frequently rely on neuroimaging as it provides non-invasive quantitative measurement of the structure and function of the nervous system. Machine and deep learning methods can, for example, refine findings for specific diseases or cohorts enabling the detection of imaging markers at an individual level. This, in turn, paves the way for personalized treatment plans. In this course, we explore the methodological gaps in analyzing high-dimensional, longitudinal, and heterogeneous neuroimaging data and study novel, robust, scalable, and interpretable machine learning models for this purpose.Students have the option to enroll in the class for either 3 or 4 units. All students, regardless of their unit choice, are expected to attend every class session. The primary class content will cover the fundamentals of machine learning, offer some limited hands-on training, and explore the application of ML to neuroimaging. Those opting for 4 units will benefit from an extra hour of instruction weekly, diving deeper into core ML concepts and receiving extended hands-on training. The scheduling of this additional hour will be determined based on the availability of the students enrolled for 4 units to ensure a mutually convenient time slot. Undergraduate students and those who do not have ML backgrounds are advised to take the course for 4 units.",

Upon his retirement he selected Dr. Rafael Pelayo to be his successor, but he continued to participate in class until his passing in the summer of 2020.  To honor his legacy in perpetuity, Dr.Pelayo renamed the course 'Dement's Sleep Dreams' as he had promised him he would.  The goal is to retain the original spirit of the course as the content is continuously updated to reflect current state of sleep science.  The course is designed to impart essential knowledge of the neuroscience of sleep and covers how sleep affects our daily lives. The course covers normal sleep and dreams, as well as common sleep disorders. Course content empowers students to make educated decisions concerning sleep and alertness for the rest of their lives and shapes students' attitudes about the importance of sleep. Students will keep track of their sleep patterns during the course. They will also participate in an outreach project to help improve awareness of the importance of sleep heath in our community. Undergraduates must enroll in PSYC 135, while graduate students should enroll in PSYC 235.",

        "description": "Considers the premises of the family-systems approach to intimate and family relationships, drawing on concepts from psychology, psychiatry, neurobiology, anthropology, and organizational behavior. Examines relationship formation and commitment, intimacy and sexuality, family development and structure, interpersonal conflict and communication, historical patterns and legacies, gender and power, and the cultural and larger systemic contexts of close relationships. Frameworks for assessing relationships and tools for changing romantic, family, and social relationships are examined in detail, and case examples illustrate the relationship change strategies of major contributors to the field. Highlights practical applications of the family-systems approach in educational, medical, business, and community settings. Students do not need to have a background in Psychology or Human Biology, and all student levels are welcome (including GSB, Law, Medicine, GSE for PSYC 239).",

Despite the emergence of a highly sophisticated and interdisciplinary system of understanding the human psyche in early Islamic history, most students of modern psychology are unfamiliar with this rich history. This course will provide a historical and contemporary review of the Islamic intellectual heritage as it pertains to modern behavioral science and how mental illness was historically perceived and treated in the Muslim world. We will begin with a discussion of Islamic epistemology, reconcile issues such as secular vs sacred sources of knowledge and tackle the mind/body dilemma according to Islamic theology. We will then review holistic schemas of health and pathology in the Islamic religious tradition, the nature of the human being, elements of the human psyche, and principles of change leading to positive character reformation. As Stanford is the academic home of Muslim mental health research globally, we will benefit from talks by guest researchers and speakers, partake in field trips to community partners, and utilize group discussions to provide students with a deeper understanding of these topics.",

Beginning with historical associations of nature and human well-being, we will use a variety of texts&iquest;some historic, some literary, some scientific&iquest;to explore the effects of nature on the human mind. Similarly, we will look at how human psychology influences our reactions to climate change, from grief, to climate change denialism, to action. The seminar has a significant out-of-doors component, including local ecosystem exploration, an applied study of &iquest;nature therapy,&iquest; and field trips to sites where clinical work on the interaction of nature and mental health can be observed first-hand. This year we are fortunate to have received a Global Studies Course Innovation Award to support our field-trips, as well as the visit of several guests nationally known for their work in the areas of climate change and mental health.",

        "description": "The face of healthcare is changing - innovative technologies, based on recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), are radically altering how care is delivered. Startups are offering entirely new ways to diagnose, manage, treat, and operate. However, few ever reach the patient - those with much more than an idea and an algorithm; they have an intimate understanding of the healthcare landscape and the technical know-how to integrate AI solutions into the medical system successfully. In this course, we tackle the central question: How can young students find feasible and impactful medical problems, and build, scale, and translate technology solutions into the clinic? Together, we will discover the transformative technologies of tomorrow that we can build today. Please see the syllabus for more information (https://t.ly/PpM2). We encourage students of all academic backgrounds to enroll; the only prerequisite is a strong passion for technology in healthcare. Course may be taken for one unit (lecture only, 11:30AM-12:30PM); or two units, which entails attending discussion section (12:30PM-1:20PM) and completing a project. The second half of each session will involve a discussion about team building, AI/Healthcare business ideas, and idea presentations. Grading criteria for 1-credit students will be based on attendance and weekly reports regarding the summary of each week's lectures (assignments). In addition to these criteria, 2-credit students will submit a business idea report and will deliver a pitch presentation in the last session in front of an invited panel.",

        "description": "(Same as LAW 806L) Client: Stanford University Vice Provost of Student Affairs, https://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/who-we-are/vice-provost-student-affairs.  Excessive alcohol consumption among Stanford undergraduates creates ahealth, educational, social, and legal problems for drinkers and for other members of the Stanford community. With the Vice Provost for Student Affairs as the client, this Policy Lab practicum explores the causes, consequences, and practical evidence to assess and address the problem. The interdisciplinary research team will examine practices and data at Stanford and other academic institutions in the context of scholarly studies and general knowledge from medicine, law, psychology, and other social sciences. As one component of formal policy research methods, the team will conduct ethnographic interviews with stakeholders.  Upper-division and graduate students from Law, Medicine, Public Policy, and social science disciplines are especially encouraged to apply.  Law students wishing to undertake R credit will perform additional research for a full report analyzing the issues and results of the collective research. R credit is possible only by consent of the instructor.

        "description": "Machine learning has driven remarkable advances in many fields and, recently, it has been pivotal in enhancing the diagnosis and treatment of complex brain disorders. Biomedical and neuroscience studies frequently rely on neuroimaging as it provides non-invasive quantitative measurement of the structure and function of the nervous system. Machine and deep learning methods can, for example, refine findings for specific diseases or cohorts enabling the detection of imaging markers at an individual level. This, in turn, paves the way for personalized treatment plans. In this course, we explore the methodological gaps in analyzing high-dimensional, longitudinal, and heterogeneous neuroimaging data and study novel, robust, scalable, and interpretable machine learning models for this purpose.Students have the option to enroll in the class for either 3 or 4 units. All students, regardless of their unit choice, are expected to attend every class session. The primary class content will cover the fundamentals of machine learning, offer some limited hands-on training, and explore the application of ML to neuroimaging. Those opting for 4 units will benefit from an extra hour of instruction weekly, diving deeper into core ML concepts and receiving extended hands-on training. The scheduling of this additional hour will be determined based on the availability of the students enrolled for 4 units to ensure a mutually convenient time slot. Undergraduate students and those who do not have ML backgrounds are advised to take the course for 4 units.",

        "description": "A mentoring program designed to expose first and second-year medical students to the rewarding fields of child/adolescent and adult psychiatry, and to increase awareness and education about child/adolescent and adult mental health issues. The early years of medical training consist primarily of didactic instruction, an almost universal challenge for students who enter medicine desiring to help and interact with patients. To increase engagement with the field, we bring clinical psychiatry to preclinical students, by interacting with patients and families, as follows.  During our weekly seminar time, we interview a patient and family one week, then offer a debriefing, Q&amp;A session the following week. The seminar includes open discussion, addressing questions about specific interactions with the child/adolescent or adult, diagnoses, and therapies used for treatment. Responses to students' questions invariably address evidence-based approaches to assessment and treatment of specific disorders, such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, autism, and attentional disorders. We also facilitate opportunities for the students to get involved in cutting-edge scientific research, networking/collaborating (including with medical students and faculty around the world), and attending professional conferences. The course is offered during autumn, winter and spring quarters and is intended as a longitudinal seminar to be taken continuously across these quarters. Medical students who cannot attend three quarters may enroll with permission of the instructor. Non-medical students interested in the course should contact the instructor.",

        "description": "This course will teach you how to think (or experience) yourself and the communities around you as a therapist does. That means coming to understand why therapists focus on early life relationships and learning, why we privilege emotions, and why we see the seeming contradictions in our lives as places for deeper understanding. In class discussions, we will consider questions such as: How do our early experiences in relationships affect the ones we create later?  Why are we more likely to segregate and point fingers when we are afraid? How can we make better use of our precious capacity for attention? What good might come from anger, sadness or guilt? Projects will include looking at how the psychological phenomena we will learn about play out in public spheres and personal ones. This is not a class about mental health, but rather about the intricacy of our feeling and thinking minds. The course will be discussion-based with a focus on experiential learning, and include weekly projects that will have you playing detective in your own life.  Prerequisites include a high degree of honesty (or the desire for this), creativity and an interest in the human experience. The course may include a field trip to a sensory deprivation float tank as we study attention. At the end of the seminar, I hope you will have a greater appreciation for the complexity of your mind and reactions, and the psychology of everyday life -- personal relationships, group functioning, tiffs between political parties. My aim is to have you learn to both take yourself very seriously and not seriously at all. This course will provide no answers, however I hope it will open channels of thought and discussion, and make your own life a little richer.",

Upon his retirement he selected Dr. Rafael Pelayo to be his successor, but he continued to participate in class until his passing in the summer of 2020.  To honor his legacy in perpetuity, Dr.Pelayo renamed the course 'Dement's Sleep Dreams' as he had promised him he would.  The goal is to retain the original spirit of the course as the content is continuously updated to reflect current state of sleep science.  The course is designed to impart essential knowledge of the neuroscience of sleep and covers how sleep affects our daily lives. The course covers normal sleep and dreams, as well as common sleep disorders. Course content empowers students to make educated decisions concerning sleep and alertness for the rest of their lives and shapes students' attitudes about the importance of sleep. Students will keep track of their sleep patterns during the course. They will also participate in an outreach project to help improve awareness of the importance of sleep heath in our community. Undergraduates must enroll in PSYC 135, while graduate students should enroll in PSYC 235.",

        "description": "Nearly 50% of Americans will meet the criteria for a diagnosable mental illness during their lifetime, and such conditions are expected to be the primary cause of disease burden globally by 2030 (World Health Organization). This course - the first university course on mental health innovation - empowers students of all backgrounds to confront contemporary challenges related to the U.S mental health crisis through curiosity, creativity, and strategy. During the quarter, students will gain foundational knowledge in mental health, develop skills necessary to apply that knowledge to solutions in a practical context, and interface with world-renowned experts in the industry. Students will also appreciate the role of cross-sector partnerships in mental healthcare leadership, and, by extension, develop effective communication, collaboration, and decision-making skills. This is partly facilitated by the course structure, which draws on students, faculty, and resources from across the University. Highly entrepreneurial and experiential, this course is ideal for future pioneers in a broad array of careers related to mental health.  Students will collaborate in multidisciplinary teams among graduate schools and undergraduate majors to design and pitch a mental health intervention with the guidance of expert faculty and mentors to improve clinical validity and scalability of the idea. Interventions may range from designing a wearable device, to creating a school-based mental health intervention, to establishing better transitions of care for the incarcerated population. Please visit www.stanfordbrainstorm.com/class for updated information on guest lecturers.  **Applications for the course are due on December 5. Students in all Stanford schools and programs are encouraged to apply! You will be notified by December 15. Please apply at: bit.ly/psyc240.**",

Despite the emergence of a highly sophisticated and interdisciplinary system of understanding the human psyche in early Islamic history, most students of modern psychology are unfamiliar with this rich history. This course will provide a historical and contemporary review of the Islamic intellectual heritage as it pertains to modern behavioral science and how mental illness was historically perceived and treated in the Muslim world. We will begin with a discussion of Islamic epistemology, reconcile issues such as secular vs sacred sources of knowledge and tackle the mind/body dilemma according to Islamic theology. We will then review holistic schemas of health and pathology in the Islamic religious tradition, the nature of the human being, elements of the human psyche, and principles of change leading to positive character reformation. As Stanford is the academic home of Muslim mental health research globally, we will benefit from talks by guest researchers and speakers, partake in field trips to community partners, and utilize group discussions to provide students with a deeper understanding of these topics.",

The future of mental health involves all of us. Organized as a speaker series, this course delivers rich and diverse content in the form of interviews and conversations between mental health clinicians, and leaders and innovators across a multidisciplinary set of fields including athletics, entertainment, journalism, politics, business, medicine/science, tech, education and beyond. Speakers will share their personal experiences with mental health, how they have led change in today's mental health landscape, and what we need to be doing to create a new future for mental health that is accessible, equitable and de-stigmatized. This series of conversations is meant to showcase the role that we can all play in addressing the mental health crisis, whether teaching students, managing a team, advocating for BLM, designing a product, or posting on Instagram. Open to all Stanford students, encourage students from all types of graduate and undergraduate programs to register. Required brief weekly reflection process.",

        "description": "One of the great gifts of literature is its ability to give us insight into the internal worlds of others. This is particularly true of that state clinicians call &quot;psychosis.&quot; But psychosis is a complex concept. It can be terrifying and devastating for patients and families, and yet shares characteristics with other, less pathological states, such as mysticism and creativity. How then can we begin to make sense of it? In this course, we will examine the first-hand experience of psychosis.  We will approach it from multiple perspectives, including clinical descriptions, works of art, and texts by writers ranging from Shakespeare, to the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, to patients attempting to describe their experience. This class is not only for students thinking of careers in medicine, psychology or anthropology, but also readers and writers interested exploring extraordinary texts. There are no prerequisites necessary; all that is needed is a love of language and a curiosity about the secrets of other minds.",

        "description": "VISITING: Closed to visitors. TYPE OF CLERKSHIP: Required. DESCRIPTION: The clerkship is designed to solidify the knowledge of psychiatry students have acquired in the Practice of Medicine courses, as students gain practical skills in the application of this knowledge to clinical situations. The focus is on interviewing skills, psychiatric evaluations, on refining diagnostic skills, and offers an overview of psychosocial and biological treatment modalities for the major psychiatric disorders. The clerkship consists of clinical work on inpatient units under the supervision of academic and clinical faculty, a weekly lecture series by academic faculty and attendance at Grand Rounds (no Grand Rounds during the summer months). Students are assigned to patient care settings in one or two of the following sites:  At Stanford: a comprehensive medical psychiatric unit (G2), an acute care psychiatric unit (H2), a geriatric psychiatric unit (GPU), the consultation-liaison (C/L), outpatient clinic block; at PAVA: inpatient research psychiatric ward specializing in the study of schizophrenia or an acute locked psychiatric ward; at MPVA: outpatient block (students will spend one day a week at PAVA; and inpatient unit: Scrivner Center at El Camino Health in Mountain View.  In addition, students participate in the specialty outpatient clinics at Stanford including OCD, child, bipolar, geriatric and general psychopharmacology clinics. Students are given the opportunity to express their preferences regarding assignment. The final rotation assignment is determined by the department based on availability of sites. Students are informed about the specific clerkship requirements at the orientation offered at the start of each clerkship period. Students will be provided with a course syllabus and three textbooks (DSM-5, First Aid in Psychiatry and Clinical Psychiatry). Requirements include mandatory attendance at seminars, weekly inpatient case history presentations and Emergency room experiences with residents/attending psychiatrists. The NBME Subject Exam in Psychiatry is a required component of the clerkship. PREREQUISITES: None. PERIODS AVAILABLE: 1-12, full-time for 4 weeks, 10 students per period.

DESCRIPTION:  In this rotation, medical students observe and participate in our outpatient addiction medication management, office-based opioid replacement therapy, group psychotherapy, multi-disciplinary assessment/consultation clinics, and available residential services located within the VA Palo Alto Health System. A typical day includes an admission, which is a typical psychiatric work-up with an additional emphasis on substance abuse assessment; group therapy meetings throughout the day utilizing various psychotherapeutic modalities; a multidisciplinary staff meeting focused on individualized care and management approaches; and a community meeting, in which milieu events are processed. The overall goal is to become familiar with general psychiatry, intensive psychotherapy, and psychosocial resources, while gaining exposure to substance abuse treatment issues. Residential programs combine elements of both inpatient and outpatient settings and are unique in this regard. The attending psychiatrist teaches history-taking, DSM diagnoses, and psychopharmacology for substance use disorders.

        "title": "Psychosomatic Medicine (Psychiatry Consultation Service) Clerkship",
        "description": "VISITING: Open to visitors. TYPE OF CLERKSHIP: Elective. DESCRIPTION: Psychosomatic Medicine (PM) comprises the area of psychiatry concerned with the psychobiological care of the medically ill, which includes persons of all ages and those cared for in specialized medical settings. PM- psychiatrists, in addition to providing expert formal psychiatric consultation to medical and surgical patients in the general hospital, specialized hospitals and outpatient clinic settings, also train psychiatrists and non-psychiatrists in the recognition of normal and abnormal reactions to illness and appropriate psychological care of patients with such reactions. The PM psychiatrist may function both as a consultant and as part of the primary medical/surgical treatment team. Via conjoint rounds and teaching conferences (primary intervention), formal consultations (secondary intervention), and involvement in inpatient treatment and discharge planning (tertiary intervention), the PM psychiatrist provides a comprehensive approach to the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral needs of the patient. Thus one unique feature of our program is how the members of our team are integral member of so many other medico-surgical teams throughout the medical center. Participation in this rotation should allow students to learn about diagnosis and management of psychiatric disorders common in all medical and surgical specialties, e.g., depression, anxiety, delirium, alcohol abuse, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders, and somatic symptom and related disorders. Students will accompany psychiatric residents, fellows and faculty five days a week in performing consultations on medical-surgical units in SUH and in performing follow-up visits. Team rounds occur every morning.  Formal didactic sessions occur twice weekly. Students will learn interview techniques, how to evaluate patients' psychosocial stressors and resources, how to write a cogent case report, present and discuss cases orally, work comfortably as a team member, perform differential diagnosis for depression, delirium, anxiety states, dementia, discuss indications and contra-indications for psychotropic medications and recognize and cope with emotional reactions to patients. Students will also learn advanced psychopharmacology, brief psychotherapy, management of difficult patients, and psychological and cultural aspects of the doctor-patient relationship.

        "title": "Subinternship in Inpatient Psychiatry",
        "description": "VISITING: Open to visitors. TYPE OF CLERKSHIP: Selective 2. DESCRIPTION: The inpatient psychiatry subinternship at Stanford is designed to provide a training experience similar to that of PGY1 psychiatry residents on an inpatient rotation. Subinternships go above and beyond the Core Psychiatry Clerkship and involve levels of intensity and commitment expected of beginning interns. While still supervised as medical students by the attendings, the subinterns should be preparing themselves mentally and physically for internship training. The subinternship at Stanford offers a diverse patient population across genders, adult ages, social economic status, and ethinicities. Of note, it offers cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy experiences, medical-psychiatry cases, forensic/hearing exposure, and ECT observation. The overarching goal of the psychiatry sub-internship is that, upon successful completion of the rotation, students will be ready to function at the level of a first-week psychiatry intern and be able to discuss his or her performance according to six ACGME competencies. Objectives that set the subinternship apart from the core psychiatry clerkship are (1) demonstrate progression from &quot;interpreter&quot; to &quot;manager&quot; in the &quot;reporter-interpreter-manager-educator&quot; (RIME) scheme; (2) efficiently manage a caseload of 3 to 6 patients at a time; (3) assist the attending in teaching patients/families, core clerkship medical students, and/or staff; and (4) evaluate his or her efforts towards self-reflective practice and self-directed learning. Please note: Visiting students must obtain approval from Ms. Quynh Dang prior to applying for this clerkship. Please email requests to qdang@stanford.edu. PREREQUISITES: Psychiatry 300A.

        "description": "VISITING: Closed to visitors. TYPE OF CLERKSHIP: Selective 2. DESCRIPTION: The inpatient psychiatry subinternship at the Palo Alto VA is designed to provide a training experience similar to that of PGY1 psychiatry residents on an inpatient rotation. The subinternship at the Palo Alto VA offers a diverse patient population across variables such as age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and diagnosis. The three week-long experience includes opportunities for robust medication management, individual and group therapy experiences (utilizing behavioral activation, cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, relapse prevention, motivational interviewing, and supportive therapy modalities), management of complex medical-psychiatry cases, forensic/hearing exposure, and the opportunity to work on a multi-disciplinary treatment team in an acute inpatient setting. Additionally, the VA is a unique system in which to work given the number of wrap-around services that serve the veteran's needs including housing assistance, substance abuse treatment, groups, and case management services. The national VA system of care therefore additionally allows a subintern to learn about systems-based practices in an applied manner. The overarching goal of the psychiatry subinternship is that, upon successful completion of the rotation, students will be ready to function at the level of a first-month psychiatry intern and be able to discuss his or her performance according to six ACGME competencies. Objectives that set the subinternship apart from the core psychiatry clerkship are (1) demonstrate progression from an interpreter to manager role in the &quot;reporter-interpreter-manager-educator&quot; (RIME) scheme; (2) efficiently manage a caseload of 3 to 6 patients at a time; (3) assist the attending in teaching patients/families, core clerkship medical students, and/or staff; (4) evaluate his or her efforts toward self-reflective practice and self-directed learning. Satisfactory completion of the core psychiatry clerkship is a prerequisite for this subinternship. PREREQUISITES: Psychiatry 300A. PERIODS AVAILABLE: 1-12, full time for 4 weeks, 1 student per period, not offered during 2023-24.
