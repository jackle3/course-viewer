The work of Galileo Galilei, Leonardo da Vinci, and others in Italy and across Europe, catalyzed the emergence of modern science, with profound changes in our worldview. The work of these Italians contributed to the rise of the scientific method, the development of modern sciences (especially astronomy, biology, physics, and mathematics), and the study of human anatomy and medicine. Technologic innovations, such as the telescope, microscope, accurate timepieces, and the printing press, were also pivotal for the Scientific Revolution. In this course we will explore the emergence of science and technology during the Renaissance and their connections to modern day scientific practice and principles, with a focus on key Italian pioneers. We will take advantage of Florence's location to visit museums and sites, and better appreciate their contributions to scientific methods and thinking.",

        "description": "Passed down through popular lore, the phrase &quot;mamma gli turchi!&quot; is still known to Italians today. This course explores the history, culture, and contemporary politics of Italy through the lens of the country's relations with Muslims and Islamic societies in the Mediterranean region. We begin in the first millennium of the common era, when Muslims ruled over large parts of Europe, including Iberia and Sicily. We then move into the Renaissance period to cover Italy's extensive relations with Islamic empires such as the Mamluks of Egypt and the Ottomans of the eastern Mediterranean and North Africa (often simply called, &quot;the Turks&quot;). Moving into the modern period, we will then examine how Italian national identity was moulded in contrast to an imagined Muslim counterpart, tracing how these ideas informed Italian colonialism in North Africa. The last part of the course focuses on contemporary issues: over the past several decades and still today, Italy has maintained particularly close relations with Muslim countries in the region. Nonetheless, immigration and the supposed menace of Islam have come to play a large role in Italian politics today. We will study these topics using a range of sources including first-hand accounts (in translation), art, and film. Key themes in the course include conquest, coexistence, conversion, migration &amp; immigration, trade, colonialism, national identity formation, the Cold War, and global political movements.",

While introducing students to a series of printing techniques and photographic processes along with studio lighting and digital postproduction methods, this course will encourage visual experimentation, theoretical contextualisation, and active research processes.  Students will be guided through the processes of developing a critical framework for their practice through tutorials and through theory seminars mapping some of the major developments and theoretical concerns within contemporary practice.  They will also be shown researching methods to reach relevant audiences: from physical installations, exhibitions and publications, to new media and the web.",

        "description": "The course aims to present a history of Florentine sculpture between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, with a focus on materiality, the symbolic value of mediums, as well as the commissioning and execution of each work of art. The classes will be inspired by current methodologies, linked to a tradition interested in the objecthood of artistic creation and the relationship between stylistic choices and the limitations of technologies. The collections of the Florentine museums and the city's extraordinary heritage, will allow direct contact with the works we will discuss in class. Proximity will also make it possible to gain knowledge about places of production and procurement of materials (the Carrara quarries, the ancient casting places, for example). This approach will not only problematize fundamental issues pertaining to the very concept of the &quot;artisticness&quot; of an artifact, but-in following a chronological span-will reflect on the periodization of formal languages characterizing the early modern era, at the same time confronting topics relevant to the current historiographical debate. Such investigations, in addition to offering an updated and problematic look at some of the most iconic figurative texts for the art-historical discussion about early modern period (from Donatello's David to Michelangelo's, via masterpieces by artists such as Luca della Robbia, Benvenuto Cellini and Giambologna), will provide students with useful paraphernalia for confronting canonized and, so to speak, sacralized figurative testimonies, putting into context the drives and motives, the conditioning and expectations behind their very creation.",

One, to analyze and discuss Italian cinema and its history; two, to develop your skills in cinematic formal analysis and in film theory.  We will start with the cinema in the Fascist years (1922-1945), we will then focus on the revolutionary and heavily politicized practice by the Neorealists (Zavattini, Rossellini, De Sica), in the aftermath of WWII (1945-1949).  We will turn to the great Italian auteurs such as Federico Fellini; Michelangelo Antonioni, and Bernardo Bertolucci.  Further, we will analyze the so called &iquest;comedy Italian style,&iquest; the &iquest;spaghetti westerns&iquest; as well as the politically committed films of the 1980s and 90s.  Finally, we will explore the &iquest;new Italian cinema,&iquest; with its many and sometimes contradictory forms.  Studying and enjoying Italian cinema will help us to uncover the socio-political, economic and cultural developments in Italian life during the 20th and 21st century (the family, otherness, gender roles, politics, etc.).",

        "title": "Un)fashionable Entanglements: Development, Workers' Movements and Regulation in Global Garment Value",
        "description": "Fashion and garment production is an old trade, and it is one of Italy's most important sectors in terms of global prestige, cultural effervescence, and exportation. Fashion entangles creativity, culture, style, and ways of life. At the same time, garment production entails complex and globalized manufacturing processes that tie together segmented labor forces with differentiated levels of work quality, rights, and regions embedded in the world economy in diverse positions and at different levels of their developmental path. Garment manufacturing is an industry forerunner in terms of productive globalization, and it is considered a starter industrial sector for economically underdeveloped regions. Early on, it presented signs of technological revolutions, the growing role of intangible assets over production, and the restructuring dynamics of production in complex, globalized and functionally integrated value chains. The sector, therefore, serves as a guide and a lens to scrutinize wide-ranging phenomena and to engage with broader theoretical debates. By analyzing the garment/fashion complex, it is possible to study globalizing production and consumption processes, the role of decent work in global production networks, and the crucial issues of economic development and transnational regulations. This course focuses on the literature that deals with garment production in Global Value Chains and explores different analytical approaches in between the theoretical traditions of economic and labor sociology and international political economy. The focus on garments allows students to deepen their knowledge of related and wider issues such as theories of development, feminist political economy, analyses of labor organizations, and the regulations for decent work across national boundaries. The course, therefore, touches upon issues of gendered exploitative mechanisms at work, labor control and surveillance, theories of labor agency and movements within the workplace and across national boundaries, as well as theories of private and public global governance for labor standards. While the course is global in its analytical scope, it pays specific attention to European and especially Italian dynamics. Readings on Italian case studies and current events are presented in almost all the weekly topics and two thematic units are dedicated entirely to an analysis of garment production processes in Prato and in Southern Italy.",

It focuses on the historical formation of the range of attitudes, ideas and sentiments of race, including racism, found in Italy today. By taking an explicitly comparative approach to racial formation and racism, it requires students to critically reevaluate their understandings of race, identity, racial politics and racism. This includes rethinking not only what are conventionally viewed as &quot;minority&quot; racial identities but also white racial identity. The learning objectives of the course are: a) to understand the political and social history that has led to the formation of current attitudes, ideas and political stances on race in Italy; b) to understand the regional variation in these attitudes, ideas and political stances; and c) to extend this new understanding to the political and social history of race in the U.S.",

        "title": "What is Love? The Amorous Discourse from Dante to Ferrante",
        "description": "Talking about love was the main reason humans ever began to speak in the first place. From the moment words were invented, they have been used to interpret and describe, in verse and prose, this powerful and mysterious force, in an attempt to interpret and describe our very selves. Lyric poetry was specifically designed for that, but even when telling stories about war, adventure, or the meaning of life and death, as well as when narrating comic or tragic events, countless writers have often endeavored to answer the question: What is love? By combining close readings of texts with a study of their literary, cultural, and historical context, and by paying attention to individual innovations as well as one's dialogue with tradition (a gendered tradition, that nonetheless stimulates fluid and even queer responses from the Renaissance forward), we will discover Dante's love, a means of damnation or salvation; Petrarch's love, which is sinful distraction, the source of poetry, and a path to glory; Boccaccio's love, so sensual and yet so deeply rooted in the human soul as to cause the greatest joy or the deepest despair; Ariosto's love, a dangerous force that can drive people to madness in a world where, after all, everyone is somehow in love and therefore partly (and delightfully) crazy; Machiavelli's love, which can sharpen one's wits and bring with it great achievements, unless it clouds one's judgement and leads to failure; Aretino's love, so unabashedly physical and graphically explicit as to cause scandal and amazement all over Europe. We will also look at how love is described by Veronica Gambara, Vittoria Colonna, Gaspara Stampa and other women poets of the Renaissance who renewed the lyrical code from within, giving new meanings to old words. We will also listen to the various kinds of love put to music in operas from Don Giovanni to Traviata and Boh&egrave;me, and we will investigate how love interrelates with history in Manzoni's Promessi sposi and other Romantic historical novels. Finally, we will explore how the previous (male) narratives about love were reconfigured and reinvented by female novelists of the 20th century such as Goliarda Sapienza, Natalia Ginzburg and Elsa Morante, who will lead us to delve into Elena Ferrante's works, where love constantly interplays with friendship, and often confirms that, for better or for worse, appearances can be deceiving.

        "description": "Why do strong green parties emerge in some countries and not in others? What differences and commonalities exist in environmentalist movements and their forms of contention across Europe? How do new and old environmentalist movements relate to social justice struggles and other societal actors? And how do environmentalist groups shape political decisions at the local, national and European Union level? This course draws on debates developed in the political economy, social movement studies, urban political ecology, and labor environmentalism literatures to analyses environmentalist social movements and political environmentalist parties in Italy and in Europe. Through the discussion of specific and existing case studies of environmentalist mobilizations, this course investigates the different opportunity structures under which environmentalist actors and coalitions emerge, the differentiated frames and repertoire of contention they adopt, and the various forms of their institutionalization. More specifically, the mobilizations against illegal toxic dumping in the 'Terra dei fuochi' in Southern Italy, the movements against environmental degradation caused by the steel plants in Piombino and Taranto, the environmentalist opposition against the petrochemical facilities in Porto Marghera and the construction of high-speed train infrastructures in Northern Italy will be used as cases to discuss the literature on environmentalist social movements. In the second section of the course, the processes of institutionalization of social movements and their transformation into political parties is discussed. The lack of a consolidated green party in Italian politics is contrasted with other successful experiences in central Europe, and the structural and actor-centered drivers of such differences are analyzed. Lastly, the role of transnational environmentalist social movements and advocacy groups is analyzed on the European and global levels. The role of environmentalist actors in the making of international environmental agreements (carbon trading mechanisms and international treaties on climate change) and in the politics of environmental policy-making in the EU (European Green Deal and its national implementation plans) are investigated. The rise of new, transnational movements such as Fridays for Future and Extinction Rebellion will be discussed.",

        "description": "There are more than seven billion humans on the planet, each of whom need to eat every day: inefficient food production and distribution practices are contributing to faster use of non-renewable fossil fuels and accelerating environmental degradation. What modes of food production and consumption may be viable, sustainable responses to this problem? What are some alternative models of food production? How are people responding to increasing inequalities relating to food availability? What can we learn from Italian food cultures in terms of sustainability? This course focuses on the radical increase in food production over the last 70 years and the ecological and social problems it has created. It will explore the possible solutions that have been suggested that include incorporating historical agricultural techniques that are more responsive to local ecology: the organic movement, regenerative farming, Slow Food, and the shift towards local food. We will critically assess these movements and analyze their potential to change the trajectory of the global food production system, which is likely to collapse without some form of rapid intervention.",

        "description": "This course introduces an interdisciplinary understanding of the concepts of gender and race and their intersectionality as a theoretical tool to trace a gendered and racial genealogy of the Italian nation. The aim of the course is to work through a variety of disciplinary approaches, from history to sociology to political philosophy, to learn to critically employ the concepts of gender, race, and nation by understanding their relationality, reciprocity, and their specific application in the field of contemporary Italian history. The course therefore includes a first part of work on the conceptual history of gender and race as well as their roots and key articulations in political history and modern philosophical thought. The work focuses on the main texts and authors of critical political thought on race and gender, with particular reference to Black feminist epistemology, decolonial philosophy and critical race theories. Critical analysis of primary sources and moments of collective debates will cross the learning path. The second part focuses on Italy as a gendered and colonial construction both in material and symbolic terms. Sources from feminist philosophy, political sociology, and Italian colonial and postcolonial history will provide tools for critical analysis and guided exercises. The third part will involve the applicative use of the whole conceptual apparatus. Participatory research and social inquiry will pivot on some past and present biographical trajectories of historical and political significance in contemporary Italian history from an intersectional perspective. The historical and social framework in which biographies are inscribed will provide a critical application field for the conceptual apparatus mastered during the course.",

Focus on Leonardo's insights into human perception, tapping the very sounds and sights of the city that drove his fascination and inspired his work. Leonardo's conviction that the soul was the point of convergence of all the senses, prompted him to ponder how sensory information is received and processed. His writings foreshadow gestalt psychology and psychoacoustics centuries before these were studied by scientists. Leonardo's fascination with perception and emotion are manifest in his art and in his inventions. Together we will explore the city that inspired da Vinci's work, and delve into the deep implications of some of his insights and inventions as they effect contemporary art, science and life.",

        "description": "This course will ask how police, prosecutors, and prisons should operate in an open, democratic society, and what opportunities and challenges democracy creates for making those institutions fair, effective, and humane. Our entry point will be Cesare Beccaria's 1764 treatise, Of Crimes and Punishments, which linked criminal justice reform with the struggle against despotism. Beccaria was a key figure in the Italian Enlightenment, and his treatise laid the foundation for virtually all subsequent efforts at criminal justice reform, in the United States as well as in Europe. Beccaria's ideas heavily influenced the American Revolutionaries, found expression in the Bill of Rights, and continue to shape discussions of policing and punishment today. We will read Beccaria's treatise, as well as secondary materials placing him in historical context and tracing his influence on the reform of criminal justice institutions in Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We will also examine a series of contemporary debates about policing, prosecution, and punishment, including calls for prison abolition and for defunding the police, and we will ask what light Beccaria's ideas can throw on those debates.  We will consider, too, the criminal-justice dimensions of the recent rise of populism and nativism, both in the United States and in Europe, and the increasing overlap between debates about crime and debates about immigration. Studying Beccaria will provide a window into the Italian Enlightenment, and tracing his influence will help us place modern debates about mass incarceration, police violence, and prosecutorial discretion in historical perspective. We may take field trips to the sites of former prisons in Florence and to Milan, where Beccaria lived and worked.",
