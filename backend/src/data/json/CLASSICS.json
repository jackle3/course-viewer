        "description": "Over two billion people alive today consider the Bible to be sacred scripture. But how did the books that made it into the bible get there in the first place? Who decided what was to be part of the bible and what wasn't? How would history look differently if a given book didn't make the final cut and another one did? Hundreds of ancient Jewish and Christian texts are not included in the Bible. &quot;What Didn't Make It in the Bible&quot; focuses on these excluded writings. We will explore the Dead Sea Scrolls, Gnostic gospels, hear of a five-year-old Jesus throwing temper tantrums while killing (and later resurrecting) his classmates, peruse ancient romance novels, explore the adventures of fallen angels who sired giants (and taught humans about cosmetics), tour heaven and hell, encounter the garden of Eden story told from the perspective of the snake, and learn how the world will end. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Judaism, Christianity, the bible, or ancient history. It is designed for students who are part of faith traditions that consider the bible to be sacred, as well as those who are not. The only prerequisite is an interest in exploring books, groups, and ideas that eventually lost the battles of history and to keep asking the question &quot;why.&quot; In critically examining these ancient narratives and the communities that wrote them, you will investigate how religions canonize a scriptural tradition, better appreciate the diversity of early Judaism and Christianity, understand the historical context of these religions, and explore the politics behind what did and did not make it into the bible.",

Is nature (phusis) stronger than law (nomos)? Of the three tragedians' respective treatments of this famous tale from Greek mythology (i.e., Aeschylus' Choephoroi, Euripides' Electra) Sophocles' play is arguably the most enigmatic, offering many different interpretations. Reading a tragedy in the original Greek is one of the greatest experiences a student of the language will ever have, and Sophocles' Elektra is a superb introduction to the extraordinary genre of Greek tragedy.

In this class, we examine the basic principles of ecological thinking in Western culture.  We explore the ways that different writers represent and conceive of the natural world.  We also analyze different environmental philosophies.  We will address the following questions:  What is nature?  Who decides what is &quot;natural&quot;?  How do humans differ from other animals?  Do these differences make us superior beings?  How do our eating habits affect the earth?  What are the philosophical arguments for vegetarianism and veganism?  How have the technologies of television, cell phones, and computers affected our relationship to the natural world?  To what extent do we dwell in cyberspace?  How does this affect our habitation on earth?  How does modern technology inform the way that we think and act in the world?  To help us answer these questions, we read nature writers (Edward Abbey, Annie Dillard), philosophers (Descartes, Heidegger), short stories (Kafka, Ursula le Guin), novelists (Conrad, Tournier) and contemporary writers (Peter Singer, Michael Pollan, Elizabeth Kolbert).",

The sagas of kings and queens sit side by side (sometimes in the same medieval manuscripts) with stories of holy men and women, and exquisite poetry in praise of nature or important persons. We will explore this largely unfamiliar but fascinating world through careful reading of the primary texts, backed up by some secondary works on history, myth, and society. In addition, the influence of early Irish literature on such later writers as W. B. Yeats and Flann O'Brien will be investigated. Readings include heroic stories of Finn and C&uacute; Chulainn; the Cattle Raid of Cooley; the Voyage of Bran; satires; bardic praise-poems; monastic poems; and Sweeney Astray (Buile Shuibhne).",

You might consider, for example, words we speak, films we watch, buildings we use, political concepts we debate, styles we admire, myths we read. This course is our chance to explore such rich diversity, emphasizing the more material kinds of `classical remembrance. Our focus will be on California, its architecture, its collections of ancient objects. Readings, to be discussed in class, will inform our treasure hunt, which will start with Stanford University collections and proceed farther afield. Pandemic permitting, we'll visit the Getty Villa in Malibu, one of the world's foremost collections of ancient art housed in the imposing reconstruction of an ancient Roman villa. We'll archive our favorite discoveries, some obvious and some intriguingly obscure, in a digital museum which our class will co-create from scratch. But this will be a treasure hunt with a difference: while pursuing it we'll develop critical awareness about the very nature of ancient Greece and Rome and its legacies. Some of the questions to discuss are: What does the term `classical' convey? How might we weigh this supposed classicism against other traditions? Which ancient voices are heard and which remain silent? To whom do the legacies of ancient Greece and Rome belong? What are the ethics involved in collecting classical antiquities? How does antiquity `read' our very selves, individually and collectively? All are welcome, whether you're new to ancient studies or an old hand. Newcomers will get a uniquely experiential introduction to ancient Greece and Rome. Others will have the opportunity to deepen selected aspects of their classical knowledge. All students will emerge from the class with a broad overview of Greco-Roman pasts; will appreciate the range of human engagements with Greco-Roman antiquity, particularly in its local and regional manifestations; will understand the nature of the 'classical' in relation to other artistic traditions; will understand the role of ancient Greece and Rome in relation to fundamental human values and questions.",

        "description": "Given the importance of art to all aspects of their lives, the Greeks had reason to respect their artists. Yet potters, painters and even sculptors possessed little social standing.  Why did the Greeks value the work of craftsmen but not the men themselves?  Why did Herodotus dismiss those who worked with their hands as &quot;mechanics?&quot;  What prompted Homer to claim that &quot;there is no greater glory for a man than what he achieves with his own hands,&quot; provided that he was throwing a discus and not a vase on a wheel?  Painted pottery was essential to the religious and secular lives of the Greeks.  Libations to the gods and to the dead required vessels from which to pour them.  Economic prosperity depended on the export of wine and oil in durable clay containers.  At home, depictions of gods and heroes on vases reinforced Greek values and helped parents to educate their children.  Vases depicting Dionysian excess were produced for elite symposia, from which those who potted and painted them were excluded.  Sculptors were less lowly but still regarded as &quot;mechanics,&quot; with soft bodies and soft minds (Xenophon), &quot;indifferent to higher things&quot; (Plutarch).  The seminar addresses such issues as we work to acknowledge our own privilege and biases.  Students will read and discuss texts, write response papers and present slide lectures on aspects of the artist's profession.",

We will delve into this rich poetic heritage, savoring the full range of modern responses, while paying attention to the many meanings of the old stories that they echo or challenge.

Even praise can be insulting, in some situations. Context is key. In this course we will study abusive speech in the context of ancient Greece and Rome. Primary readings will range from Homer and Aristophanes to Plautus and Seneca, as well as vernacular sources such as ancient wall-graffiti and curse tablets. Throughout we will use modern sources such as film, music, and political speeches for comparison. We will also explore different sociological, anthropological, and linguistic models for understanding the social role of insult. Studying the slippery phenomenon of insult reveals a great deal about human communication, human nature, and the Classical tradition. No knowledge of Latin, Greek, or Linguistics is assumed or required for this course.",

We will also explore how large-scale games were funded and how they fostered the development of sports medicine.

        "title": "The Good Life:  An Introduction to Ancient Greek Ethical Philosophy",
        "description": "The ancient Greeks longed for happiness, but life often led to suffering and anxiety.  In ancient Greece, the traditional value system focused on gaining honor, wealth, power, and success - external goods that could be taken away at any time.  The Greek philosophers Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle set forth ethical theories designed to alleviate suffering and anxiety.  They rejected the traditional Greek value system, focusing on inner goodness rather than on external rewards.  Developing inner goodness was the only way to live a happy and fulfilled life.  In this class, we read Greek tragedies by Sophocles and Euripides that represent traditional Greek values.  We examine the values, motivation, and choices of tragic characters who faced difficult ethical dilemmas - choices that led to misery and ruin.  What were their tragic flaws?  Could they have avoided their fates by adopting a different value system?  We also examine the ethical theories of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.  We analyze their discussions of justice, courage, friendship, love, and self-knowledge.  Do these philosophical theories offer a valid way to live a happy life?  Can we develop these virtues?  If so, how do we do this?  Do we need to have these virtues to live a happy life?  Do the ancient philosophers offer useful solutions to ethical questions in our own day?  Can their philosophies help us to become better and happier people?",

Book 3 is considered by many to be the finest of the entire poem, for Lucretius offers here a response to the fact of human mortality that is nothing short of ennobling and liberating.

However, Latin-speaking people wrote sophisticated texts, on every variety of topic both pagan and religious, for thousands of years after this. So: In this class we will defy convention and strike out to explore the rich tradition of Late Latin literature. Readings will include both &quot;&quot;literary&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;vernacular&quot;&quot; texts, covering (among other things) inscriptions, papyrus letters from Egypt and Africa, the poetry of Ausonius and Proba, selections from the history of Gregory of Tours, and the lively travelogue of Egeria. In parallel, we will also explore the history of Latin during the Empire, emphasizing the historical developments that distinguish Late Latin from &quot;&quot;Classical&quot;&quot; Latin. Students should be able to read Latin at an Intermediate-to-Advanced level, but no experience with linguistics, Late Latin, or Roman history is expected or required.",

Reading out loud in class will be required, but memorization not required. Class will also cover the linguistics of Homer's archaic language, etymological histories of the words he uses, his poetic formulas and his other poetic devices. Central to this class will be recordings made by Ioannnis Stratakis which are available for purchase at AncientGreek.eu. This class in Singing Homer will be a rare attempt to recover and make alive the sounds of Homer's great epic poems.",

We will consider the ways in which such issues emerge, are explicitly treated, or are ignored in a variety of historical and contemporary settings with a particular emphasis on the impact that war and conflict have on laws and norms that in principle aim to protect individuals from violence and exploitation. This inquiry also entails consideration of the modern notion of the universality of human rights based on a conception of a common humanity and how alien that concept is in states and communities that define or embody hierarchies that systematically exclude groups or populations from the protections and respect that other groups and individuals are afforded. Nowhere do the devastating consequences of such exclusions become clearer than in times of crisis and conflict. The course draws upon a variety of case studies from the Greco-Roman world and other temporal and geographical contexts to explore the political and social dynamics that shape and inform the violence inherent in such events.",

The narrative interweaves the themes of the dome as image of the Cosmos, religious icon, national landmark, and political monument. It examines the dome not only as a venue for structural innovation, but also metaphysical geometry and transcendent illusionism.nIndividual case studies will familiarize you with major architects from Hadrian to Richard Rogers and historical milestones from the Dome of the Rock to the Capitol in Washington DC.

The dialogues in question are not with ancient shades in the underworld but with later artists who build on the creative vision (and blind spots) of the past to addressthe issues of their day.Roman philhellenes, Renaissance humanists and Neoclassical loyalists have received much attention. More remains to be explored in the work of modern and contemporary artists such as Romare Bearden, Robert Mapplethorpe, Lawrence Argent, Daniel Arsham, Yinka Shonibare and Xu Zhen.In the Cantor Center and the Rodin Garden, the artist's debts to antiquity run deep; freed from his shadow, Camille Claudel's bronzes reflect the sunlit surfaces of Greek sculpture. On Meyer Green, the capital puns of Xu Zhen reverberate from Shanghai to Athens, from archetypes in the Louvre to galleries around the world, where classical &quot;icons&quot; - subverted, inverted and recharged - engage contemporary eyes. Classical tragedy spoke to war-weary Greeks in the 5th century. Today, Sophocles and Bryan Doerries' Theatre of War Productions help veterans to feel less alone as they return to civilian life bearing the wounds of war, visible and invisible. The vibrant and varied afterlife of Greek art is the subject of the seminar, but we will not ignore the sinister aspects of its legacy: the advertising industry's Botoxic embrace of &quot;Greek perfection,&quot; the quest for fitness at any price and the persistence of white, western, ableist ideals of male and female beauty. Darker still is the lethal appropriation of classical art and architecture by genocidal tyrants and racists. These dialogues are deadl",

        "description": "As is well known, great and emerging power rivalries largely shaped the course of the 20th century through WWI, WWII, and the Cold War. In the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the 21st century been characterized by the geopolitical reconfiguration underway today with the rise of China and India and the challenges posed for American and European influence. The end of the Cold War brought hope that the proxy wars, post-colonial conflicts, and mass atrocity events that characterized the mid-20th century would yield to a more stable international order of cooperation and, hence, to a greater realization of the human rights aspirations embodied in the UN framework. The founding of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2002 was widely hailed as a watershed event marking that transformation. Needless to say, those hopes have remained largely unrealized and the refusal of China, India, the United States, and Russia to join the ICC is indicative of how far away a realization of those aspirations remains. As this age of great power political, economic, and military rivalry intensifies how is it impacting both the countries where the rivalries are being played out (e.g.,in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Africa) and the societies of the rival nations themselves? How are these conflicts affecting the response to global humanitarian issues such as migration, refugees, statelessness, human trafficking, modern day slavery, climate change, and the turn towards increasing authoritarian governance? The course will explore the humanitarian dimension and consequences of war, conflict, and political transformation in such contexts through a series of case studies.",

We will then evaluate the impact of ancient discourses of forced displacement on the modern world, with a focus on American immigration policies.

Through this, we consider and engage with our own changing societal values surrounding such themes and objects. Students also learn and engage with multiple methodological and theoretical approaches that have been used to analyze &quot;erotic&quot; wall paintings and artifacts, including but not limited to psychoanalysis, &quot;male gaze&quot; theory, queer theory, and master-slave narratives.",

Tackling the most fundamental questions that have confronted an ancient civilization from the turn of the twentieth century to the present, the course investigates how &quot;classics&quot; and &quot;classical tradition&quot; acquire different meanings and functions in changed contexts, and serves as a convenient introduction to key moments and figures in modern Chinese cultural and intellectual history.",

        "description": "Modern political theorists, from Hobbes and Rousseau, to Hannah Arendt and Leo Strauss, to Sheldon Wolin and Robert Dahl, have turned to the classical Greek theory and practice of politics, both for inspiration and as a critical target. The last 30 years has seen renewed interest in Athenian democracy among both historians and theorists, and closer interaction between empiricists concerned with 'what really happened, and why' and theorists concerned with the possibilities and limits of citizen self-government as a normatively favored approach to political organization. The course examines the current state of scholarship on the practice of politics in ancient city-states, including but not limited to democratic Athens; the relationship between practice and theory in antiquity (Thucydides, Plato, Aristotle, and others); the uses to which ancient theory and practice have been and are being put by modern political theorists; and experiments in democratic practice (citizen assemblies, deliberative councils, lotteries) inspired by ancient precedents. Suggested Prerequisites: Origins of Political Thought OR The Greeks OR other coursework on ancient political theory or practice.  (For undergraduate students: suggest but do not require that you have taken either Origins of Political Thought, or The Greeks, or some other course that gives you some introduction to Greek political history or thought. )",

        "description": "The class considers the development of Greek art from 1000-480 and poses the question, how Greek was Greek art? In the beginning, as Greece emerges from 200 years of Dark Ages, their art is cautious, conservative and more abstract than life-like, closer to Calder than Michelangelo. While Homer describes the rippling muscles (and egos) of Bronze Age heroes, his fellow painters and sculptors prefer abstraction. This changes in the 7th century, when travel to and trade with the Near East transform Greek culture. What had been an insular society becomes cosmopolitan, enriched by the sophisticated artistic traditions of lands beyond the Aegean &quot;frog pond.&quot; Imported Near Eastern bronzes and ivories awaken Greek artists to a wider range of subjects, techniques and ambitions. Later in the century, Greeks in Egypt learn to quarry and carve hard stone from Egyptian masters. Throughout the 6th century, Greek artists absorb what they had borrowed, compete with one another, defy their teachers, test the tolerance of the gods and eventually produce works of art that speak with a Greek accent. By the end of the archaic period, images of gods and mortals bear little trace of alien influence or imprint, yet without the contributions of Egypt and the Near East, Greek art as we know it would have been unthinkable.",

        "description": "The class begins with the art, architecture and political ideals of Periclean Athens, from the emergence of the city as the political and cultural center of Greece in 450 to its defeat in the Peloponnesian War in 404. It then considers how the Athenians (shell-shocked from war and three outbreaks of plague) and the rest of 4th century Greece rebuild their lives and the monuments that define them.  Earlier 5th century traditions endure, with subtle changes, in the work of sculptors such as Kephisodotos.  Less subtle are the outlook and output of his son Praxiteles. In collaboration with Phryne, his muse and mistress, Praxiteles challenged the canons and constraints of the past with the first female nude in the history of Greek sculpture. His gender-bending gods and men were equally audacious, their shiny surfaces reflecting Plato's discussion of Eros and androgyny. Scopas was also a man of his time, but pursued different interests. Drawn to the interior lives of men and woman, his tormented Trojan War heroes and victims are still scarred by memories of the Peloponnesian War, and a world away from the serene faces of the Parthenon. His Maenad, who has left this world for another, belongs to the same years as Euripides' Bacchae and, at the same time, anticipates the torsion and turbulence of Bernini and the Italian Baroque.  The history and visual culture of these years remind us that we are not alone, that the Greeks grappled as we do with the inevitability and consequences of war, disease and inner daemons.",

A second goal is to learn how work with very different kinds of evidence: bone injuries, ancient weapons, gladiator burials, laws, graffiti written by gladiators or their fans, visual images of gladiatorial combats, and the intricate architecture and social control of the amphitheater.

Rather than a static and inert structure, the Great Church emerges as a material body that comes to life when the morning or evening light resurrects the glitter of its gold mosaics and when the singing of human voices activates the reverberant and enveloping sound of its vast interior.  Drawing on art and architectural history, liturgy, musicology, and acoustics, this course explores the Byzantine paradigm of animation arguing that it is manifested in the visual and sonic mirroring, in the chiastic structure of the psalmody, and in the prosody of the sung poetry.  Together these elements orchestrate a multi-sensory experience that has the potential to destabilize the divide between real and oneiric, placing the faithful in a space in between terrestrial and celestial.  A short film on aesthetics and samples of Byzantine chant digitally imprinted with the acoustics of Hagia Sophia are developed as integral segments of this research; they offer a chance for the student to transcend the limits of textual analysis and experience the temporal dimension of this process of animation of the inert.",

This seminar aims to examine the role of ethnographic practice in the political agendas of past and present African nations. In the quest to reconstruct an imaginary of Africa in space and time, students will explore these social constructs in light of the rise of archaeology during the height of European empire and colonization. Particularly in the last 50 years, revived interest in African cultural heritage and preservation raises complex questions about the problematic tensions between European, American, and African theories of archaeological and ethnographic practice.",

Following a historical and cross-cultural perspective, we will study the causes of economic decline, the social and political consequences of that decline, and the path that led to the collapse of some of the most prosperous societies in human history. Among the episodes we will cover are the Late Bronze Age collapse in the Eastern Mediterranean, the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and the Classic Maya collapse. We will compare these ancient episodes with recent cases of socioeconomic decline, including the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the downfall of Venezuela under Chavismo. We will use the past to reflect on the fundamentals of harmony and prosperity in our society and the challenges that they will face in the future.",

We also have an astonishing range of Latin texts by people of every background: women, the enslaved, soldiers, merchants, travelers, non-native Latin users, even idle passerby. These documents range from single words to expansive treatises, simple greetings to complex rites; all inform the &quot;story of Latin&quot; as much as the elite &quot;literary&quot; writing of the Classical period, and are crucial evidence of life during Roman times. This course will introduce students (graduates and advanced undergraduates) to the study of Latin across time and context, with two major goals: 1) to make this sometimes overwhelming topic accessible; and 2) to better understand the rich cultural influences that shaped Latin in use. Coursework will include introductions to major corpora (e.g., inscriptions, vernacular tablet letters, graffiti, non-elite literatures) and associated methodologies (e.g., epigraphy, material studies, historical linguistics), in addition to detailed study and discussion of important texts. Intermediate-to-advanced knowledge of Latin will be assumed, but NO background in linguistics, epigraphy, material culture, and Roman history is expected or required.",

Drawing on new approaches that have hardly escaped academic  journals and seminar rooms, we will avoid the plot of the well-worn stories and focus on the way the ancient world worked around the key concern of membership &iquest; who belonged to civic community and who didn&iquest;t, on what grounds, and with what consequences. The class will take you back to the origins of city life in the Near East, to the princely societies of Bronze Age Europe to show how the scene was set for the success of the city states of the Mediterranean, and how important it is to maintain a big perspective on Greece and Rome. Not afraid to offer critique of orthodoxy, we will share alternative views of familiar and unfamiliar features of antiquity, in the arts and culture, the likes of poetry and portraiture, philosophy and religious institutions, and in politics, including misunderstandings of Athenian democracy and Roman military might. You will come away from the class with a new view of antiquity and why we should still be fascinated by its relevance to today. Advanced undergraduates are welcome to register.",

As the only extant tragedy from Greek antiquity featuring characters who explicitly reflect on their black skin color, Suppliants destabilizes a monolithic definition of alterity as fifty black Egyptian Greek women transform from frightened maidens into astute performers. In line with their interrogation of foreignness in the Suppliants, students will examine Euripides' characterization of Medea. Namely, after Medea learns that her husband will marry another woman, she kills her own children and leaves a foreign country with her safety intact. Altogether, students will increase their knowledge of Greek grammar and syntax and become familiar with essential aspects of Greek tragedy in primary and secondary sources.",

Overall, this course will help prepare students for translation and general examinations, though naturally it can only gesture in that direction: full preparation is the student's responsibility. Since the aim of Core III will be to place Latin literature in a broader historical context, readings from overviews such as G.B. Conte, Latin Literature: a history and Michael von Albrecht's A History of Roman Literature will be useful. The course will also be wider in scope than Latin Core I-II, and for the sake of efficiency, will be organized by genre, with particular emphasis on Comedy, Satire, and the Novel. Philological commentaries by D. Christenson (Pl. Amph.), S. M. Braund (Juv.), and M. Smith (Petr.) will provide our major reading, along with shorter selections from Terence, Horace, and Apuleius.  Course readings will also include some key scholarly works, in order to help students reach a high-level overview of Latin literary history. Limited class time will be devoted to Latin translation and stylistic analysis; discussion will instead emphasize historical developments. Course assessments will include regular writing assignments and several exams, with a view to preparing students for the Latin Literature examination.",

Students will have to submit written translations from English into Latin every week; during the term&iquest;s final third, they should expect to be working on longer compositions too (around 150 words in length).",

These issues include slavery, human trafficking, gender based violence, discrimination against marginalized groups, and how these and other issues are linked to war, internal conflict, and imperialism. We will consider the ways in which such issues emerge, are explicitly treated, or are ignored in a variety of historical and contemporary settings with a particular emphasis on the impact that war and conflict have on laws and norms that in principle aim to protect individuals from violence and exploitation. This inquiry also entails consideration of the modern notion of the universality of human rights based on a conception of a common humanity and how alien that concept is in states and communities that define or embody hierarchies that systematically exclude groups or populations from the protections and respect that other groups and individuals are afforded. Nowhere do the devastating consequences of such exclusions become clearer than in times of crisis and conflict. The course draws upon a variety of case studies from the Greco-Roman world and other temporal and geographical contexts to explore the political and social dynamics that shape and inform the violence inherent in such events.",

In recent decades interest have shifted to include a heavier emphasis on economic, social and cultural history encompassing issues of gender, cultural representation and identity, and economic performance.  Whereas the traditional historiography of the earlier 20th c largely coincided with our elite male-authored texts, the newer interests require different types of evidence and analytic skills.  This proseminar offers a very brief exposure to a wide range of approaches and evidence, including demography, numismatics, material culture, epigraphy, law, and digital tools.

Course discussions will range broadly from the ethical and philosophical facets of Humanities education, to various practical and logistical issues specific in graduate-level teaching.

        "description": "Modern political theorists, from Hobbes and Rousseau, to Hannah Arendt and Leo Strauss, to Sheldon Wolin and Robert Dahl, have turned to the classical Greek theory and practice of politics, both for inspiration and as a critical target. The last 30 years has seen renewed interest in Athenian democracy among both historians and theorists, and closer interaction between empiricists concerned with 'what really happened, and why' and theorists concerned with the possibilities and limits of citizen self-government as a normatively favored approach to political organization. The course examines the current state of scholarship on the practice of politics in ancient city-states, including but not limited to democratic Athens; the relationship between practice and theory in antiquity (Thucydides, Plato, Aristotle, and others); the uses to which ancient theory and practice have been and are being put by modern political theorists; and experiments in democratic practice (citizen assemblies, deliberative councils, lotteries) inspired by ancient precedents. Suggested Prerequisites: Origins of Political Thought OR The Greeks OR other coursework on ancient political theory or practice.  (For undergraduate students: suggest but do not require that you have taken either Origins of Political Thought, or The Greeks, or some other course that gives you some introduction to Greek political history or thought. )",

Cities are the fastest changing components of the human landscape and are challenging our relationships with nature.

We will unpack such topics by tracking the genealogy of qualities of life in the ancient Near Eastern city states and those of Graeco-Roman antiquity, with reference also to prehistoric built environments and cities in the Indus Valley and through the Americas. The class takes an explicitly human-centered view of urban design and one that emphasizes long term processes.",

We will read a Roman gynecological manual, an ancient dating guide, the world's first harlequin romance novels, ancient pornography, early Christian martyrdom accounts, stories of female and male saints, instructions for how to best battle demons, visionary accounts, and monastic rules. These will be supplemented by modern scholarship in classics, early Christian studies, gender studies, queer studies, and the history of sexuality. The purpose of our exploration is not simply to better understand ancient views of gender and sexuality. Rather, this investigation of a society whose sexual system often seems so surprising aims to denaturalize many of our own assumptions concerning gender and sexuality. In the process, we will also examine the ways these first centuries of what eventually became the world's largest religious tradition has profoundly affected the sexual norms of our own time.

Rather than a static and inert structure, the Great Church emerges as a material body that comes to life when the morning or evening light resurrects the glitter of its gold mosaics and when the singing of human voices activates the reverberant and enveloping sound of its vast interior.  Drawing on art and architectural history, liturgy, musicology, and acoustics, this course explores the Byzantine paradigm of animation arguing that it is manifested in the visual and sonic mirroring, in the chiastic structure of the psalmody, and in the prosody of the sung poetry.  Together these elements orchestrate a multi-sensory experience that has the potential to destabilize the divide between real and oneiric, placing the faithful in a space in between terrestrial and celestial.  A short film on aesthetics and samples of Byzantine chant digitally imprinted with the acoustics of Hagia Sophia are developed as integral segments of this research; they offer a chance for the student to transcend the limits of textual analysis and experience the temporal dimension of this process of animation of the inert.",

Coursework will include introductions to major corpora (e.g., inscriptions, vernacular tablet letters, graffiti, non-elite literatures) and associated methodologies (e.g., epigraphy, material studies, historical linguistics), in addition to detailed study and discussion of important texts.

Despite the seeming banishment of poetry from the ideal polis in Plato&iquest;s Republic, the Platonic dialogues evince a sustained engagement with poetry and poetic models. Proclus famously declared that the same reasoning in the Republic &quot;would require us to banish not only Homer but Plato himself from the state . . .&quot; In this course we will concentrate in depth on those sections from Plato's dialogues that consider poets and poetry, focusing especially on Plato's Republic, Protagoras, Gorgias, Phaedrus, Ion, and Apology. We will also examine the power of poetry and the significant role it played in ancient Greek culture and educational practices, reading selections from a number of poets, including Homer, Hesiod, and Pindar.",

We will examine the role proverbs play across the many different genres of Greek literature as part of a larger &quot;quotation culture&quot; in antiquity, as evinced in oral performance, ancient reading habits, and educational practices. Part of our study will involve tracing the use, reuse, and transformation of certain proverbs to the extent that they become autonomous literary works in their own right. This will lead us to consider what separates a &quot;quotation&quot; from other discourse. Does anyone ever speak without &quot;quoting&quot; something? Texts include selections from Homer, Hesiod, Greek lyric poetry, Greek tragedy and comedy, Herodotus, Plato, and Aristotle. We will also have a special guest lecturer, Prof. Matthew Wright from the University of Exeter, on the surviving fragments of ancient Greek tragedy and Athens' quotation culture during the week we examine proverbs in tragedy.",

Sensitive to contemporary experience of this paradigm takes in techno-humanism that looks to the potential of technology to augment human capability, embracing the co-evolutionary entanglement of humanity and technology. Through archaeological case studies at the cutting edge of theory and methodology the seminar offers unique insights into a matter of common and pressing concern - just how are we to conceive of our humanity in times of runaway change?",

Needless to say such a course mustby nature be highly selective in topics and readings given the broad historical,theoretical, and interdisciplinary scope of such a combination of topics (or of any one of them). We will read a selection of classical texts in historical sociology, social and legal theory, and anthropology, as well as more recent major contributions on relevant topics. The goal of the course is to engage in discussions and reflection that will stimulate further exploration in contemporary , legal, and political theory to inform dissertations and other research initiatives. Discussing the broad range of texts in the reading list below will provide a starting point for developing interdisciplinary frameworks within which to address the kind of cross-cutting issues that make up the substance of the seminar. The following list of readings represents examples of the kinds of issues and texts the seminar will take up. In our first meeting we will consult on the list and select 9 books to read, the first of which will be selections from Weber's Economy and Society (Selections, because the whole text is approximately 1100 pages.) Two seminal texts that are not on the list, Foucault's Discipline and Punish and Bourdieu's Outline of a Theory of Practice are already familiar to many students who have expressed an interest in the seminar, so I have not included them. List of Readings: M. Weber, Economy and Society (selected sections), B. Anderson, Imagined Communities; E. Gellner, Nations and Nationalism; J. and J. Comaroff, Etnhography and the Historical Imagination; S. Malesevic, The Sociology of War and Violence; A. Giddens, The Constitution of Society; A. Sen, The Idea of Justice; J.

This course will also investigate the ways that Black diasporic artists have engaged with, revised and re-imagined Greco-Roman classics, both in order to expose and critique discourses of racism, imperialism, and colonialism, and as a fertile source of mythological material. It is the hope that the diverse array of material (collage, graphic novels, novels, oral literature, poetry) will invite diverse intellectual engagement. With this in mind, this course has been designed for students interested in Classics, African American Studies, African Studies, and Comparative Literature.",

This seminar explores concepts of mobility and migration through their varied material remains, situating the Classical world in dialog with urgent contemporary issues of decolonization, environmental and economic migration, and border regimes. We consider how differing mobilities affected people&iquest;s lives and informed their views of themselves and others, and how politics of mobility played out within Mediterranean connectivity. The nature and experience of past mobilities and migrations, and growing scholarly interest in their complexity, provide a lens through which to detect and interrogate its historical and ongoing impacts.",

This seminar explores scholarly work (mostly in the last 15 years) that has developed a more realistic view of the ancient Greek economy and some of the recent responses to that new paradigm.
