        "title": "The Economic Survival of the Performing Arts",
        "description": "Even the most artistically accomplished and well-managed performing arts organizations--symphony orchestras, operas, dance companies, and many theaters--tend to live on the edge financially. In fact, most performing arts groups are organized as nonprofit organizations, because they cannot make enough money to cover costs and survive as profit-seeking businesses. In this seminar we will explore the reasons for the tension between artistic excellence and economic security,drawing on the experience of performing arts organizations in the United States and in countries(whose governments have adopted quite different policies toward the arts). Using economic concepts and analysis that we develop in the seminar, you will first examine the fundamental reasons for the economic challenges faced by performing arts organizations. In later sessions, we will consider and evaluate alternative solutions to these challenges in the United States and other countries. The seminar may include meetings with managers and/or trustees of arts organizations.nnnBy the end of the seminar, you will be able to assess the economic condition of an arts organization, evaluate alternative strategies for its survival, and understand the consequences of alternative government policies toward the arts.nnnDuring the early part of the course, you will prepare two short papers on topics or questions that I will suggest. Later, you will prepare a longer paper applying concepts learned to one of the performing arts or a particular arts organization that interests you. You will submit that paper in stages, as you learn about concepts and issues that are relevant to your analysis. There will also be a final exam.",

        "title": "Impact: Investing for Good",
        "description": "Investing for Good will introduce students to the entire spectrum of purposeful, values-driven, and impact investing. We examine the field from the perspective of an institutional investor (i.e. fund manager, investment advisor, endowment manager, head of a family office, etc). Our goal is to have students emerge with a practical and analytical framework for: 1. evaluating impact and mission-aligned investments across multiple asset classes and sectors; 2. constructing a portfolio using impact as a lens; 3. designing an impact investment company; and 4. understanding the many practical and theoretical challenges confronting this exciting emerging field.We start by exploring some fundamental questions: what is a purposeful or impact investment; can impact investments be defined along a spectrum between conventional investing and philanthropy; whose money is it; what are the constraints and opportunities; how do we (re)define return and/or performance. We briefly analyze impact investing in the context of modern portfolio theory. We then develop a framework for portfolio construction and evaluation across four criteria: risk, return, liquidity, and impact. Through a combination of class dialogues, role plays, and case discussions, we will explore a wide variety of asset classes, impact themes, and investment challenges. A series of team-based investment committee simulations will comprise a significant portion of the course and will provide a significant experiential learning experience.Previous experience in finance, investing, social enterprise, entrepreneurship, or philanthropy is not required, but both helpful and welcomed. While first year students are encouraged to enroll, students who have limited familiarity with the basics of investing and corporate finance are strongly encouraged to purchase David Swensen's &quot;Pioneering Portfolio Management&quot; and cover the recommended chapters in advance of the course. It's is also important to note that this class will require financial modeling and detailed investment analysis.Many of the issues we'll be tackling have no unambiguous answers. Lively discussion and debate will be necessary and expected.",

Our main perspective is American and executive: decisions faced by the U.S. President, Governors, and their advisors. The lessons can extend to certain international settings as well. We have two main goals:n1. To begin to build your personal policy approach, in which you will figure out how your values translate into real-world policy choices; and 2. To learn what it is like to be a senior policymaker. Each week will cover a different policy topic. Likely topics include immigration reform, economics, whether and when and how companies should take public positions on policy issues, guns and gun control, social media policy challenges, the opioid crisis, and trade and industrial policy. Our exact topic schedule is flexible based in part on current events. This class is heavily participatory and involves a lot of class discussion. You will write 5-10 weekly short memos to explain your choices. This class is for beginners and assumes you have no prior knowledge of policy or politics.",

This course explores these issues in depth. We examine the past, present, and future of the complex political economy surrounding real estate finance, its impact on markets, and the business challenges and opportunities arising from it, both domestically and abroad, before and after the financial crisis. We then tackle recent trends like the rise of shadow banks, fintech, and proptech. Through a mix of speakers, case studies, and hands-on exercises, we examine the problems these industries are solving and creating. Greg Buchak is an Assistant Professor in the Finance group at Stanford. He received his PhD in financial economics and JD in law from the University of Chicago. His research focuses on the industrial organization of financial intermediation and its consequences in the real estate industry. Chris Mahowald is actively involved in the real estate investment business as the managing partner of RSF Partners, a series of real estate private equity funds totaling over $1 billion in equity.  The firm invests across product types throughout the U.S. During his career, he has focused on value investing with deep experience in distressed mortgage debt.

        "description": "There is no denying that we are in the AI-era: around 90% of tech executives today embrace AI and want to expand its use. Firms will be newly created to focus on AI products, or large firms will find new capabilities in AI products or processes.  How will AI be used to create a sustainable competitive advantage for these firms? For this course, you do not need any prior experience or in-depth technical knowledge of AI; you will learn it along the way. This course invites guest speakers who run businesses at the forefront of AI to tell their stories and develop students' understanding of the business value of AI. Our speakers range from serial entrepreneurs to executives at well-known companies, all helpful in offering valuable insights from a myriad of industries and perspectives. Some key questions are the following. Should a company adopt AI, given that many but not all of its competitors are? Should they develop their own AI tools, or would it be easier to acquire a startup outright? And for startups, what are the ways they market themselves? Why, and how, did particular startups succeed? And, in cases when there is a winner-take-all market, why did early investors believe in them?  This class utilizes interactions with guest speakers and some Role Plays and lectures. The course requirements are three 800-word memos, one consulting-like group project, and class participation.",

You will engage in legislative debate, offering amendments, voting, and extensive policy and legislative negotiation, with the goal of enacting new laws. The simulated legislative agenda involves four policy topics: economic growth and income distribution, climate change, regulation of &quot;Big Tech,&quot; and an international issue. As a class, you will try to enact a new law in each of these four areas. This class is for beginners. You will: -Learn a bit about four policy issues (likely climate change, economics, regulation of &quot;Big Tech,&quot; and an international issue); -Learn both the formal and informal rules of legislating-how a bill really becomes a law; and -Develop and practice your &quot;soft skills,&quot; including persuasion, negotiation, leadership, strategy, and organizational analysis.",

        "description": "Small teams of students will propose and implement projects to provide immediate volunteer civic assistance to a group or community dealing with the effects of coronavirus. We assume most or all of this assistance will be online or otherwise virtual. The first goal of this course is to channel your skills, abilities, and civic impulses to provide immediate practical assistance to communities struggling with new, unsettling, and painful coronavirus realities. The second goal is to allow you to practice leadership, management, problem-solving, and interactive skills in a small team through a project they build from scratch and implement immediately. The third goal is to build and strengthen your interest in participating in leadership roles in the civic layer of society after graduation. Students will form teams of four, either before or shortly after the course begins. A team will propose a target group to assist: a place, a group of people, or a non-governmental civic organization. Your team will interact directly with leaders of that target group to discover what value you can provide immediately and virtually. Weekly class sessions will include some guest speakers and work sessions in which the various teams will share their ongoing efforts, to cross-fertilize ideas and assist each other. Teams will also meet extensively outside of class hours to build and implement their project. This course is an active learning experience. Teams will be evaluated in part based on their ability to deliver rapid results of value to a target community. Doing so will require significant commitment and effort from the team, and a willingness to adapt to difficult, changing conditions. All projects must be targeted entirely at addressing new needs created by the coronavirus crisis, not at solving problems that existed before then. They should be easy to begin initial execution in the first 2-3 weeks of the quarter, to provide rapid assistance to the target group. Projects must be nongovernmental and apolitical: no politics, no government work or government services, no interest groups whose primary purpose is to influence public officials. Teams should instead aim to provide direct benefits to a community in the civic layer between individuals and government including businesses, volunteer groups, community organizations, non-profits, clubs, charities, religious and fraternal organizations. Many of these efforts are arising spontaneously each day; our goal is to foster and amplify this trend. Since projects must be feasible with the team dispersed and in self-isolation, most efforts will be online or virtual, and teams are encouraged to think of creative uses of tools like Zoom, Google Apps, social media, and simple database setups. Interdisciplinary teams from across Stanford graduate programs are encouraged, as long as three of the four team members are from the GSB. International students are strongly encouraged to participate, both in joining teams with an American focus and in forming teams to target communities for assistance outside the U.S. Teams are encouraged to look at opportunities to form bridging capital, aiding groups and communities that might not overlap much with the Stanford student population. We hope several teams will be geographically-focused, targeting the people who live in a specific place for assistance. In addition to the project itself, each student will be expected to keep a project journal and to write an end-of-project memo to those considering similar civic efforts in the future.",

        "description": "Successful leaders have to conceive, author, rebuild, pivot, differentiate, and finally maintain a personal reputation to make a lasting, recognizable and powerful identity. Reputation Management will explore how you can effectively communicate to create, adapt and maintain your personal reputation. Your reputation remains fluid as you navigate your career decisions and interact with different professionals along your journey. The course is designed along three interlocking elements: reputation management literature, relevant case studies, and curated guest speakers. Students will learn the fundamentals of strategic corporate communication and the risk of not managing reputation effectively. These frameworks will be extended with specific case studies to illustrate where individuals, groups, and firms have faced the challenge of managing reputation effectively. We will focus on both traditional and virtual components of communication including the relevancy of online reputation management. Finally we will invite well-known leaders from a range of industries who have built and sustained their reputations, through effective communication. Each leader has had to manage their reputations in the public eye, and alongside their peers, supervisors, and employees. Guests will be invited to discuss their conscious and unplanned strategies of how to successfully communicate the kind of person, leader, innovator, or public figure they strive to be. Students will benefit from a rich blend of frameworks, cases, and speakers enabling them to successfully enter the work force and create their own, personal reputations. Students will create a case study drawn from their own experience (or personal network), of a reputation dilemma. A final assignment requires students to research their own reputation history by projecting what they think their reputation is, creating their own survey for friends, colleagues and employers to take, conduct three interviews about their personal reputation with three individuals who have worked closely with them, and then synthesize all this feedback into a cohesive paper and short video that reflects their authentic work and personal reputation.  Throughout the course students will post at least one blog drawn from class concepts and respond to posts by peers in the class.",

Included in this part is a closer look at countries for which the production and export of fossil fuels is a key economic activity. We then turn to the competitiveness of carbon-free or low-carbon technologies in different segments of the economy, including i) power generation, ii) energy storage, iii) transportation, iv) industrial production and v) food and Ag Tech.

        "title": "Technology Licensing: Strategy and Negotiation",
        "description": "Licensing of technology and its corresponding intellectual property is big business, and integral to the business plans and competitive strategies of start-ups and Fortune 500 companies alike. Because licenses are complex agreements with important legal consequences, it is tempting for business executives to delegate to lawyers the negotiation of the 'non-economic terms' of their companies' technology license agreements. The problem with such an approach, however, is that at their core, issues of license structure, scope and risk require business judgments, and not merely legal ones. Do we need exclusive rights, and if so, to what, where and for how long? Will this prospective licensee bring our technology to market, and how do we mitigate the risk that it fails to do so? Can this licensor support our development efforts, and will it stand behind its IP in the event of a problem? Do we expose the guts of our technology to the world and try to protect it with patents, or do we keep it close and rely upon trade secrets? While counsel can offer advice on all these questions, they cannot know your business and competitive environment as you do, or be relied upon to optimize business trade-offs that must align not just with your company's present markets and strategies, but with those you expect it to pursue in the future. This course is organized around two hypothetical companies seeking to negotiate a technology license agreement. Divided into teams representing one or the other of these companies, students collaborate over multiple sessions to develop a strategic business approach and then to negotiate the critical terms of a licensing agreement. Lectures are focused on the business, and to a lesser extent, legal issues arising in complex licensing arrangements, and are designed to give students the context and perspective they need to participate effectively in licensing strategy development and negotiation. By immersing teams of business students in a multi-session licensing negotiation, it is the objective of this course to enable them to better understand and more effectively navigate the strategic business issues that arise in the conceptualization and negotiation of technology license agreements.",

Most companies are not started by MBAs; most startups are not funded by VCs; most employees don't work for tech firms; and most firms don't sell out to other businesses or go public. Rather, the vast majority of companies world-wide are started, funded, owned, and governed by families, and these firms create most of the employment in the global economy. Despite the prominence of family firms, most MBA courses focus on the widely-held or Silicon Valley model of the firm. This course explores the challenges and opportunities faced by family businesses. It is co-taught by Leo Linbeck III, Lecturer since 2005 at the GSB and President and CEO of Aquinas Companies, LLC, and Thomas Brenninkmeijer, a leader in his family business of Cofra Holdings AG. This course is an outlier in a world obsessed with tech startups and venture capital; it is a &quot;Minority Report&quot; from the heart of Silicon Valley. The course is intended for four main audiences: (1) Students whose family owns a business. (2) Students who are considering working for a family firm. (3) Students who are interested in acquiring or consulting with a private firm either directly (search funds, management consultants, etc) or indirectly (private equity, etc). (4) Students who are sick of only learning about cool, sexy startups and the geniuses who get rich from them. The course uses a combination of case studies, guest speakers, lectures, movies, projects, and reflections to explore the central ideas of the course, which are likely to appear irrelevant to everyone (save the instructors) but are intended to be informative and entertaining.",

        "title": "Energy Markets and Policy",
        "description": "This is a course on how energy and environmental markets work, and the regulatory mechanisms that have been and can be used to achieve desired policy goals. The course uses a electricity market game as a central teaching tool. In the game, students play the role of electricity generators and retailers in order to gain an understanding of how market rules(including environmental regulations and renewable energy mandates) affect the business strategy of market participants, and in turn economic and environmental outcomes. The goal of the course is to provide students with both theoretical and hands-on understanding of important energy and environmental market concepts that are critical to market functioning but not always widely appreciated. Concepts covered include: 1)regulated price-setting versus price-setting through market mechanisms, 2) BTU arbitrage in input energy choices, 3) uniform price vs. pay-as-bid auctions, 4) the ability and incentive to exercise unilateral market power, 5) unilateral versus coordinated exercise of market power, 6) transmission congestion, 7) forward contracts and their effect on market functioning, 8) dynamic pricing of electricity and active involvement of final demand, 9)the nature of energy reserves, 10) carbon pricing mechanisms including taxes and cap-and trade systems, 11) renewable portfolio standards and other renewable energy incentives,12) determination of levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and its impact on new capacity investment decisions, and 13) interactions between environmental mechanisms and regulations. We will also discuss the key features of the markets for major sources of energy such as oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear, solar, wind, and biomass. The course is useful background for private sector roles in energy production, research, management, trading, investment, and government and regulatory affairs; government positions in policymaking and regulation; research and policy functions in academia, think tanks, or consultancies; and non-profit advocacy roles related to energy and the environment.",

        "description": "Negotiation is a central part of business in the worlds of sports and entertainment. This course will examine negotiation dynamics and key takeaways for general management from multiple different settings where negotiations had an important role--these will include preparing for a negotiation, the negotiation process itself, contractual outcomes of negotiation and their execution and in some cases litigation. The settings will include negotiations over player and actor contracts, negotiations between leagues and players associations, negotiations between investors and movie companies, and negotiations between content providers (both in sports and entertainment) and distribution partners (such as cable stations, international media companies, and online companies such as Netflix). Each of the six sessions is planned to include at least one and in some cases two guests that have had extensive experience in negotiations.",

The first part focuses on both basics and common misunderstandings.  This includes the role of income growth, population growth, regional growth, efficiency growth, and poverty.  The second part begins with integrated assessment models and reasons for disagreement among prominent models.  (Students are expected to understand public goods dilemmas and free-riding.)  It then proceeds to an obvious but often overlooked basic and essential fact: these models upon which all activist and government actions are based are unrealistic academic exercises.  They are not even asking the right questions.  Thus, United Nations treaties and carbon footprint initiatives are distractions rather than solutions.  The third part discusses where clean and other technology is as of 2022 and what it will still take to reduce global warming.  It also discusses why some prominently proposed technologies are hopeless, too; while other cheaper actions have remained unused (lost opportunities).  Dissent and discussion, seminar-style, is encouraged.  The grade will be based primarily on a midterm and take-home final, with some flexibility for students interested in doing more.",

This course explores the contemporary higher education industry, focusing especially on the places where disruptions of all kinds present significant opportunities and challenges for entrepreneurs, investors, and the businesses that serve this huge global market, as well as for faculty, students, and higher education institutions and leaders, both incumbents and alternatives. Using a variety of readings and case studies to better understand recent disruptions and the unbundling occurring across the postsecondary landscape, from outside and inside the academy, both for-profit and non-profit, the course will examine technology in teaching and learning; the future of the degree and alternatives to the traditional credential; accreditation; competency based education; affordability, student debt, and education financing models; investing in the education space; workforce, skills development, and lifelong learning; and tertiary products and platforms that serve the student services market. Guests will include higher education leaders and practitioners, as well as investors, entrepreneurs, and social entrepreneurs. (Please note, the focus of this course is post-secondary education, skilling/lifelong learning, and learning in the workplace. It does not cover K-12 or early childhood education).",

        "description": "This is a course to help future business leaders understand the policy risks that result from the changing relationship between the United States and China.Driven in part by policy decisions over the past decade in Washington and Beijing, the world built by the West after World War II is changing. Most American policymakers now label the relationship between the U.S. and China as one of strategic competition. They are often less clear on whether this term applies to the governments, the peoples, the businesses based within each country, or the two nation-states. At the same time, these two superpowers also have shared interests. We seek to understand the changing relationships between the U.S. and China, and what both competition and possible cooperation between their governments mean for others. American business leaders may be caught between two governments with conflicting interests. Business leaders in other countries may be caught among three governments: America, China, and their home-country government. This is a course not about China per se, but instead about the interactions between these two superpowers' governments and policies.We will look at the U.S.-China relationship by unpacking and examining distinct elements, devoting 1 or 2 class sessions on each topic.Relying in part on guests with practical expertise in some element of the U.S.-China relationship, our goals are to understand:* The most significant changes in Chinese policy direction in the Xi era;* Changes among Western leaders' policy approaches as they have realized their 50-year-old policy toward China either was wrong or is now out-of-date;* What the strategic competition label might mean and how it could translate into specific policy changes in both countries;* What opportunities exist for cooperation and mutual benefit despite strategic competition;* How China might try to change the post-WWII international rules and organizations;* How leaders of global businesses, in the U.S., China, and other countries, are caught between these two governments;* What decoupling in certain industries might mean; and* Possible ways to think about these issues as the U.S.-China relationship evolves.",

The diverse constituencies with interests in sports issues (athletes, fans, media companies, advertisers, and legislators to name a few) will be discussed. Sports issues at a global level (the IOC) and both U.S. and outside U.S. will be covered. There will be coverage of evolving business ventures related to the sports industry (such as venture backed sports companies and sports networks). A key focus is on how the sports industry is similar to and different from other industries. Key concepts underlying the course are: value creation/value sharing; revenue ecosystem; virtuous circles and vicious circles; disruptive technologies; growth facilitators and growth inhibitors; leveragable assets/inherited liabilities; and entrepreneurship/new product innovations. Over 80% of the sessions typically will include a guest co-lecturer from the sporting industry.",

This course teaches skills and bodies of knowledge relevant to these roles, covering topics such as designing, implementing, scaling, and evaluating social strategies; systems thinking; decision making under risk; psychological biases that adversely affect people's decisions; methods for influencing behavior; and pay-for-success programs. The large majority of the course will be devoted to students' working in teams to apply these concepts and tools to an actual problem, with teams choosing whatever problem interests them.",

        "description": "This elective 3- unit course is offered with Pass-Fail grading  to MBA students who aspire to improve their ability to deal effectively with difficult professional and personal interpersonal situations.  Class is held Tuesday, 3:10-6:10 PM. The course will be taught by William F. Meehan III, the Raccoon Partners Lecturer in Management and Senior Partner Emeritus, McKinsey and Company, and Charles G. Prober, M.D., Professor of Pediatrics, Microbiology &amp; Immunology and Senior Associate Vice Provost for Health Education, Stanford School of Medicine. The course, which is case/vignette-based, involves frequent student-to-student and student-to-instructor role-playing in authentic business and medical interactions. GSBGEN 368 is cross-listed with Inde 238, which draws primarily medical students, and part of the learning environment of the course is the mix of perspectives and vignettes we role play and discuss. Topic-specific experts often will be present to participate as class guests. Relevant principles of professionalism, leadership, and psychology underlie the course pedagogy.  Students will be expected to attend all classes unless excused in advance.nClass preparation will include reading of assigned cases/vignettes, analysis of the situations presented and recommendations as to how to confront specific difficult conversations; and reading of assigned background material. It is important that all students participate actively in classroom discussions. Class size will be limited to 45 students per the following: (1) a maximum of 30 MBA students and (2) a maximum of 15 medical or other non-GSB graduate students. GSB students enroll under GSBGEN 368. Please email Dr. Prober or Professor Meehan directly if you have any questions.n.",

        "description": "All leaders face a host of challenges, but women leaders encounter an additional set of obstacles and considerations-institutional, economic, cultural-that their men counterparts most likely never will. Women from underrepresented groups experience these challenges even more acutely. GG370 Power of You: Women in Leadership will prepare students to successfully identify and respond to these challenges, and, ideally, transform them into opportunities for growth and advancement. Students will come away from this course with a vast portfolio of strategies, tools and tactics to not only meet these workplace challenges head-on, but also create more inclusive processes, policies and cultures for the future. The course is based on the instructor's `accessible leadership' model that inspires and equips students to access the leader within themselves, empower others to access their own leadership potential, and create greater access through their giving. Through readings and guided, weekly written reflections, students will deeply explore issues including, but not limited to: the likeability paradox; sexism in the workplace; diversity, inclusivity, and belonging; intersectional identities; managing voice, narrative and reputation; negotiation through a gendered lens; leadership styles and adaptivity; mentorship and sponsorship; and creating social value. Students will engage directly with industry leaders such as Sheryl Sandberg (Facebook), Meg Whitman (Quibi), Dr. Priscilla Chan (Chan Zuckerberg Initiative), Mary Barra (General Motors), Judy Smith (Smith &amp; Company) and Indra Nooyi (Pepsi Co.), among others.",

If we aspire to address challenges across social, economic, and political arenas, with highly charged moral implications and multiple stakeholders, we have an imperative to use all available tools by discovering, celebrating, and advancing diversity in leadership.In this course, we will: (1) study a range of effective leadership approaches; (2) develop broad, transportable skills and frameworks required to lead in any complex setting - business, public sector, nonprofit sector; (3) delve into leadership tradeoffs and tensions; (4) explore and understand our own values and tacit and explicit decision-making criteria; and (5) recognize barriers to diversity and tactics to address them.  Guiding questions will include: How does the context shape the solution set? What does inspired and inspiring leadership look like? How do race/gender/other identities enter into the equation? How do I develop my own brand of leadership? We will examine contemporary leaders and controversies in education and elsewhere, draw upon timeless historical thinkers, enjoy the wisdom of guest speakers, and work intensively in small groups to highlight challenges, opportunities, and tradeoffs. By exploring a range of approaches and situations, we will strive for deeper understanding of ourselves and of the context to become a more capable, empathetic and effective leaders.",

Philanthropy is resource, background, age, profession, and industry agnostic, and &quot;Individual Philanthropy: Giving Models, Purpose &amp; Practicum&quot; will amplify your ability to make your giving, volunteering, service and leadership matter more. You have extraordinary potential to create social change, and this course will empower you with the perspective, experience and inspiration to actualize that potential both immediately and over your lifetime. You will be exposed to a diverse array of giving models and approaches, and be given structured space to weigh and appraise your individual philanthropic point of view and approach. Through deep introspection, you will define and/or refine your social change purpose and create a theory of change that maps how you will transform your values, beliefs and resources (including intellectual, human, network, experiential and financial capital) into measurable social value. Class activities will include debates and simulations such as discussing the benefits and challenges of diverse giving models, creating personal giving strategies, giving fundraising pitches and assessing actual foundation grant proposals. Each student will select and complete due diligence on a local nonprofit and create a formal grant proposal. Students will peer-review grant proposals, participate in a multi-stage grantmaking process and allocate $20,000 of grants funded by the Learning by Giving Foundation and Andreessen Philanthropies. Students will also have the unique opportunity to directly connect and engage with globally renowned philanthropic leaders, including Darren Walker (Ford Foundation), Laura Mu&ntilde;oz Arnold (Arnold Ventures), Justin Steele (Google.org), Crystal Hayling (Libra Foundation) and Holden Karnofsky (Open Philanthropy Project), among others.",

Our point of view will be that of the students as the designer of a new intervention and - presuming the intervention proves to be compelling and merits advancement - future founder(s) of a new social venture (nonprofit, for-profit or hybrid) or champion of a new intervention adopted by an existing social sector organization. We will explore in-depth the elements of successful interventions in the social sector that can achieve outsized impact. This will be achieved through lectures by the instructor on the topics at hand; discussion of illustrative case studies of many of today's award-winning impact models, and class-time in which students will be able to develop their ideas and benefit from guidance and feedback from the instructor, their classmates, and class guests. Students will work in teams as appropriate. Those students that have a pre-conceived idea for a new intervention will be encouraged to recruit others (from the GSB and/or from other disciplines across Stanford) to join their team.

Subsequently, specific examples of global and national regulatory dynamics that affect technology development are discussed in areas such as renewable energy, energy storage, solid waste reduction, food production, cement and steel production, hydrogen, autonomous/ electric vehicles, shipping, and the fashion industry. Relevant experiences of different countries will be presented including Danish policies to encourage a local wind-turbine industry, German programs to expand solar energy and Israeli government initiatives to foster sustainable Watech and Food tech companies. Potential outcomes of the recently enacted the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act will then be considered. The final section of the course involves analysis of specific case studies assessing Climate Tech companies in different stages of their development. Students will research a range of clean tech companies&iquest; experience and consider the way policies affect their business plans, financing, research portfolios and ultimate success or failure.

        "description": "The last few years we have created significant challenges and opportunities in education; there has never been a more pressing and urgent need in our history to foster entrepreneurship in education by leveraging new technologies. This course will help you develop the skills and strategies necessary to effectively create and evaluate educational services and education technology startups much like educators, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, and venture capital investors do. Some questions we will discuss include: How do entrepreneurs, educators, and VCs evaluate and grow successful education and edtech startups? Why do most startups in edtech fail, and what are the key ingredients for success, especially in today's challenging times? What does it take to get venture capital financing in edtech? Each week will feature a different edtech entrepreneur as a guest speaker; these leaders hail from a variety of innovative for-profit and non-profit education technology startups. As we hear from the speakers, we'll evaluate all aspects of their invention, particularly in the context of emerging distance learning and hybrid learning trends. A fundamental question we'll explore in this course is how educators and technologists can better collaborate to leverage the scale and impact of technology to improve educational equity and access. This course will be taught in person; attendance at each session is required. Juniors, Seniors and graduate students of all Stanford schools are welcome.

Students enrolled in GSBGEN394 will participate in class sessions on Mondays and Thursdays from 1:30-2:50 and, as a practicum, manage 45-minute debriefs of the GSBGEN 495 webinar series each week. Students will be able to note their preferred time for the practicum, which will be offered Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays from 12:15-1:00 or 6:15-7:00.",

        "description": "Healthcare spending is now nearly 18% of the entire GDP of the U.S. economy. The S&amp;P healthcare sector has been one of the best producing segments of the market for the last decade, and growth of healthcare expenditures continue to escalate at a rapid pace. Given the experiences of COVID, every single company must now at least understand how healthcare affects their business. This has triggered an abundance of opportunities for those interested in a career in healthcare management, investing, or entrepreneurialism. The Business of Healthcare-2022-23 will present the current market framework from the eyes of a clinician and with the perspective of the consumer-patient, but with the experience of a successful business builder and investor. Course will begin with the discussion of the channels of distribution of healthcare delivery, from providers, to practitioners, to consumer-facing 'healthcare lite' sectors of the market. Impact of the regulatory environment, with specific focus on the Affordable Care Act and the impending plans to Repeal/Replace, will be evaluated. High-level exploration of international health care markets and how they compare to the American market will be included. Overview of venture and private equity investing will be deeply probed, with many specific market examples of how investors develop an investment thesis, identify specific targets, diligence companies, and close an investment. Discussion around building financial modeling for target acquisitions will be presented, and the course will delve into the burgeoning area of healthcare analytics and outcomes management, including Artificial Intelligence, and its future impact on positioning, reimbursement and clinical outcomes, as well as value-based care. Sectors that will be discussed include: Healthcare services, Healthcare IT, Life Sciences, Pharma and Biotechnology, and Managed Care. The topic of the emerging importance of consumerism will be probed and consumer-directed healthcare related products and services will be explored, e.g. nutraceuticals, wellness, fitness, etc. Course will include preparatory readings, presentations from successful and powerful industry leaders, and robust in-class discussion and case studies requiring student engagement. Final grade will consist of class participation, one minor in-class presentation, and a final paper developing either a new healthcare business start-up proposition or presenting an identified investment target in the healthcare industry. Course will be especially valuable for those interested in a career in starting a healthcare company, healthcare investing, healthcare administration, or other healthcare-related management and goal of class will be provide an in-depth overview of how to get started or advance a professional interest in the industry.",

        "title": "Impact: Investing for Good",
        "description": "Investing for Good will introduce students to the entire spectrum of purposeful, values-driven, and impact investing. We examine the field from the perspective of an institutional investor (i.e. fund manager, investment advisor, endowment manager, head of a family office, etc). Our goal is to have students emerge with a practical and analytical framework for: 1. evaluating impact and mission-aligned investments across multiple asset classes and sectors; 2. constructing a portfolio using impact as a lens; 3. designing an impact investment company; and 4. understanding the many practical and theoretical challenges confronting this exciting emerging field.We start by exploring some fundamental questions: what is a purposeful or impact investment; can impact investments be defined along a spectrum between conventional investing and philanthropy; whose money is it; what are the constraints and opportunities; how do we (re)define return and/or performance. We briefly analyze impact investing in the context of modern portfolio theory. We then develop a framework for portfolio construction and evaluation across four criteria: risk, return, liquidity, and impact. Through a combination of class dialogues, role plays, and case discussions, we will explore a wide variety of asset classes, impact themes, and investment challenges. A series of team-based investment committee simulations will comprise a significant portion of the course and will provide a significant experiential learning experience.Previous experience in finance, investing, social enterprise, entrepreneurship, or philanthropy is not required, but both helpful and welcomed. While first year students are encouraged to enroll, students who have limited familiarity with the basics of investing and corporate finance are strongly encouraged to purchase David Swensen's &quot;Pioneering Portfolio Management&quot; and cover the recommended chapters in advance of the course. It's is also important to note that this class will require financial modeling and detailed investment analysis.Many of the issues we'll be tackling have no unambiguous answers. Lively discussion and debate will be necessary and expected. This course is a 2-unit version of GSBGEN 305.",

        "title": "Strategic Pivoting for your Next Chapter",
        "description": "Many students come to the GSB with the intent to pivot upon leaving the institution.  Some students feel they have outgrown their position or business, or they feel drawn to a new area that better suits their values and interests, where they can make a greater contribution. Some students have no idea what they want to do after graduating, they just know they want to make a purposeful change. And finally, some students want to strategically change their direction for reputation reasons.  The average U.S. employee tenure is only 4-5 years and job roles often change dramatically within that timeframe. Pivoting is an intentional, methodical process for nimbly navigating career changes.  A recent Gallup study revealed that almost 90% of workers are either 'not engaged' or 'actively disengaged; from their jobs. A pivot is a change made of your own volition when you have reached a point in your career when you are ready for increased challenge and impact. Strategic Pivoting is a course specifically developed for any student who already plans to pivot in their career and wants to figure out how to successfully build and create their next chapter. In this course we will discuss four stages for how to best pivot:  1) Planting, how to assess and set a strong foundation of values, strengths and interests. 2)  Scanning, researching new and related skills, talking to others, and mapping potential opportunities. 3) Piloting, students conduct small, low-risk experiments to test their new direction, as well as gather real-time data and feedback. And 4) Launching, pulling the trigger, fully committed, to your carefully plotted pivot. The ultimate pay-off to Strategic Pivoting is acknowledging and adapting to a rapidly changing society when it comes to career paths. Because our careers are so fundamentally tied to our livelihood and sense of confidence, purpose and meaning, changes can be traumatic without a road map for traversing them. &quot;Navigating this accelerated pace of change and this transitional career state, and learning to embrace it instead of resisting it, can become an edge and advantage.&quot;  Alex Rodriguez, Major League Baseball icon, ABC/Fox Sports/ESPN commentator, entrepreneur, and CEO of A-Rod Corp will be a featured Guest Speaker in this course. Alex has also had a history of successfully pivoting his career and defying expectations. He is presently getting ready to host his own ESPN interview show called, &quot;Pivot.&quot;",

        "description": "Social ventures require leadership, funding, expertise, skills and networks to get off the ground, grow and scale. This course will focus on the key strategies for building and leveraging a network of champions to capitalize a social venture at early-stage, and for sustaining and growing that network as the venture grows. This class is applicable to intrapreneurs, changemakers within major institutions, (private or public), board members, impact investors, those who aspire to be senior leaders within social ventures and social entrepreneurs (founders). Co-led by a practicing venture philanthropist and a social entrepreneur, this interactive, pragmatic course will: - Discuss the critical financial and human capital needs of organizations and companies at different life stages. - Explore the concept of champions and the different types of champions including board chairs, co-founders, mentors, faculty advisors, donors, investors, community evangelists, and fellow entrepreneurs. - Learn about effective networks and how to build them, including the role of communications, relationship-building, and crisis management. - Explore the concept of a powerful vulnerability and the art of &quot;influence without authority&quot; in attracting financial and human capital to the mission and making social ventures happen. Special emphasis will be given to developing co-founders and founding teams, boards and funders/investors as champions. - Develop a roadmap for the ways you will support social ventures throughout your career. - Meet social entrepreneurs and their champions who promote them within various power structures (major corporations, government, the institutional funding community) to learn about the successes and failures of their partnerships. Guest speakers will be posted prior to start of class. - Invite you to join instructors, guest speakers and fellow students for casual dinner on both Wednesdays after class.- Get to know your fellow classmates who share a passion for addressing the world's intractable problems and for creating systemic change.",

        "description": "GSBGEN 514 - Creating High Potential Ventures in Developing Economies (2 Units) This course addresses the distinctive challenges and opportunities of launching and growing high-potential new ventures in developing economies. Developing economies are attractive targets for entrepreneurs because many are just starting to move up the growth curve, and they offer low-cost operating environments that can be great development labs for potentially disruptive innovations. They increase in attractiveness when their political institutions stabilize and they become more market-friendly. At the same time, developing economies pose serious challenges. Pioneering entrepreneurs take on significant risks to gain early mover advantages. Specifically, entrepreneurs will not be able to count on the same kind of supportive operating environments that we take for granted in the developed world. They often face cumbersome permit and licensing processes, poorly developed financial and labor markets, problematic import and export procedures, unreliable local supply chains, weak infrastructure, corruption, currency risks, limited investment capital, lack of financial exits and more. This course is designed to help would-be entrepreneurs - both founders and members of entrepreneurial teams - better understand and prepare for these issues as they pursue the opportunities and address the challenges to start, grow, and harvest their ventures in these environments. GSBGEN 514 is a seminar/discussion format in which students will read about and discuss the key challenges described above and potential solutions. Guests will describe their own startup and investing experiences in developing economies and answer questions. A framework based on the World Economic Forum (WEF) report on &quot;Entrepreneurial Ecosystems Around the Globe and Company Growth Dynamics&quot; will be used to structure the course. Each student will prepare a short write-up as a final assignment on a case chosen from a selection provided by the instructors. Note: Groups of students who want to work as a team to investigate a specific new venture idea in addition to participating in the seminar/discussion sessions should also consider enrolling in GSB534, offered in Spring term.",

This class will deep dive into the eCommerce industry to understand its competitive dynamics, success factors, business models and strategic dimensions. The class will have a global perspective, focusing on various aspects of eCommerce in the US as well as Asia, including China and India in particular. More broadly, the class will use the industry as a microcosm for how to build and succeed in modern data and technology driven markets. This is important because success in eCommerce requires bringing together in a meaningful way several disparate aspects including efficient supply chains, well functioning product marketplaces, frictionless payment systems, meaningful content, hardware and devices, as well as facilitating advanced search, advertising and marketing technology. Additional factors such as managing vendor and supplier relationships, fraud, user reviews and private labels make the industry complex and provide learnings for several other verticals. For instruction, we will use a mix of cases and lectures, and leverage significant participation from several eCommerce industry leaders.",

        "title": "Creating a New Venture in a Developing Economy",
        "description": "This course addresses the distinctive challenges and opportunities of launching high-potential new ventures in developing economies. Developing economies are attractive targets for entrepreneurs because many are just starting to move up the growth curve, and they offer low-cost operating environments that can be great development labs for potentially disruptive innovations. They increase in attractiveness when their political institutions stabilize and they become more market-friendly. At the same time, developing economies pose serious challenges. Pioneering entrepreneurs take on significant risks to gain early mover advantages. Specifically, entrepreneurs will not be able to count on the same kind of supportive operating environments that we take for granted in the developed world. They often face cumbersome permit and licensing processes, poorly developed financial and labor markets, problematic import and export procedures, unreliable local supply chains, weak infrastructure, corruption, currency risks, limited investment capital, lack of financial exits and more. This course is designed to help would-be entrepreneurs - both founders and members of entrepreneurial teams - better understand and prepare for these issues as they pursue the opportunities and address the challenges to start, grow, and harvest their ventures in these environments. GSB534 uses a team-based project to learn about and develop solutions to the key challenges described above and potential solutions.  A framework based on the recently published World Economic Forum (WEF) report on &quot;Entrepreneurial Ecosystems Around the Globe and Company Growth Dynamics&quot; will be used to structure the course along with a few lectures and guests who describe their own startup and investing experiences in developing economies and answer questions.  The team-based projects are based on students' ideas; classmates will form teams of their choosing to explore a specific country and investigate an idea's viability. Students must come in willing to be team players and do the work necessary to complete this exercise over the full quarter.  Teams of AT LEAST 3 STUDENTS EACH will be formed before the start of class or on the first day of class at the latest so students can decide if they want to enroll. The team will describe, in a final presentation, the challenges and opportunities in their country using the WEF framework. The final presentation will also include the team's thoughts on the viability of their proposed venture and how it capitalizes on their country's assets and addresses its challenges. A detailed business plan is not required; however, specific recommendations and plans for next steps that would be carried out during a 3 to 6-month field and market research study in the country will be part of the final presentation.  Students who would prefer to learn more about this subject in a lecture/case discussion format should also enroll in GSB514, offered in Winter term.",

It is about rethinking our role as humans and leaders in this ever-changing world and developing a mindset that leads to positive habits and creates strong relationships to nurture our planet. In a world where success is frequently regarded as a stopping point rather than a stepping stone to future endeavors, this mindset is critical to leading a life of purpose and meaning. In this class we invite you to rethink: - a sustainable self, by moving away from focusing on the short-run win associated with attaining a goal to the longer-term benefits associated with continued improvement after the goal has been achieved thereby sustaining healthy habits. - sustainable connections, by helping people feel they are valued members of a winning team on an inspired mission.n- sustainable planet, in small ways that ripple out small communities and the planet; the hope is to create a culture of shared prosperity. The goal of the class is to facilitate dialogue, knowledge exchange, and collaboration among students and guests to create a sustainable toolkit to cultivate positive habits for our future based on a sense of shared prosperity. Lastly, we'll map out how to use time in ways that will help build sustainable lives (calm mind and healthy body), impactful teams and a beautiful planet, so each of our lives will have meaningful, lasting impact in the world.",

        "title": "Family Business",
        "description": "Believe it or not, the &quot;Silicon Valley model&quot; is irrelevant to most businesses. Most companies are not started by MBAs; most startups are not funded by VCs; most employees don't work for tech firms; and most firms don't sell out to other businesses or go public. Rather, the vast majority of companies world-wide are started, funded, owned, and governed by families, and these firms create most of the employment in the global economy. Despite the prominence of family firms, most MBA courses focus on the widely-held or Silicon Valley model of the firm. This course explores the challenges and opportunities faced by family businesses. It is co-taught by Leo Linbeck III, Lecturer since 2005 at the GSB and President and CEO of Aquinas Companies, LLC, and Thomas Brenninkmeijer, a leader in his family business of Cofra Holdings AG. This course is an outlier in a world obsessed with tech startups and venture capital; it is a &quot;Minority Report&quot; from the heart of Silicon Valley. The course is intended for four main audiences: (1) Students whose family owns a business. (2) Students who are considering working for a family firm. (3) Students who are interested in acquiring or consulting with a private firm either directly (search funds, management consultants, etc) or indirectly (private equity, etc). (4) Students who are sick of only learning about cool, sexy startups and the geniuses who get rich from them. The course uses a combination of case studies, guest speakers, lectures, movies, projects, and reflections to explore the central ideas of the course, which are likely to appear irrelevant to everyone (save the instructors) but are intended to be informative and entertaining. This is a compressed version of GSBGEN 334.",

        "description": "Software is eating the world, with radical consequences for financial services.  This course will give you a foundation for understanding the future of financial services, and guide you in creating fintech businesses in the 2020s and beyond. The course has three objectives.  First, we study the transformation of financial services through software, surveying payments, deposits and credit cards, securities and derivatives, capital markets, digital assets (including cryptocurrencies and blockchain mechanisms), financing and lending, wealth and asset management, and regulation and compliance. Second, we invite leading innovators to address how software has shaped their experiences; identify fundamental drivers; and forecast trends, challenges, and opportunities. Third, we present a roadmap for the evolution of the financial system, where traditional dichotomies -- trader / engineer, buy side / sell side, regulated / non-regulated, infrastructure provider / infrastructure user, data provider / data consumer -- give way to an ecosystem organized around producers and consumers of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), the rise of platforms and financial cloud providers, and the transformation of Wall Street economics into software economics. The lecturer is a computer scientist, entrepreneur, executive, investor, and risk manager.  As a Stanford doctoral student, he worked on machine learning and probabilistic inference in the late 80s.  Over the past 19 years, he has held multiple roles as a partner and senior leader of Goldman Sachs, including Chief Information Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and global co-head of the Firm's largest and most complex business, the Securities Division.  He also founded and led Kiodex, an early software-as-a-service company for risk analytics.  Kiodex became a part of SunGard (now FIS) in 2004.",

(3) What is it that leaders actually do? (4) How do they do it? (5) How are leaders developed? (6) Why do leaders succeed or fail? (7) What about your potential for leadership and your strategy for developing it? Our primary objective in this seminar is to achieve a deeper understanding of the nature and role of leadership in organizations. Our approach will be to examine a small sample of the literature, together with the amazing story of Ernest Shackleton and his Endurance crew, and then to probe several key questions through lively class discussion. The discussion, informed by the readings and also by our collective experiences, will seek to develop some general principles and observations about leadership - particularly about how you might better develop yourself as a leader.",

        "description": "The health care system accounts for almost 20% US GDP and is one of the fastest growing segments of the economy. This two-unit class focuses on the interplay and tension between the main players in the health care field - providers of health care services (individual doctors, group practices, integrated health care systems), payors (insurances companies, employers, consumers, and government), patients, and innovator companies (biopharma, medical device, diagnostics, and health care IT). The course is designed for students with a broad diversity of backgrounds and interests who want to better understand the health care business and system. No prior experience in the health care or medical field is assumed or needed. The focus of the class will be primarily on the US health care system, but there will be limited discussion of non-US systems as well. The course is divided into four modules: An overview of the US Health Care System and the interplay between payers, providers, innovators, and patients;  Provider delivery models, health care information technology, and incentive structures;  The relationship between quality, cost, and access; Integrated systems, value-based, and fee for service models ; New IT technologies, including electronic data records; The role of information and incentives; Innovator business models and issues; Financing and managing new product development; Clinical trial management and gaining regulatory approval; Marketing, reimbursement, and sales strategies; Business models to drive innovation; Health care system reform and comparisons of the structure of the US Health Care system to that of other countries. The class will be taught primarily from the perspective of a business person operating a company rather than that of a policy maker, academic, or investor. While there will be a few lectures to provide background and frameworks for course topics, most classes will involve a case discussion and prominent guest speakers from the health care industry. Speakers will include CEOs, senior executives, and partners from leading companies and venture firms.",

        "description": "The neoliberal orthodoxy that corporate managers' sole duty is to maximize shareholders' financial value (shareholder primacy) has never been entirely adhered to in practice and has been increasingly challenged in recent decades. While acknowledging the importance of shareholder value, commentators have argued that corporations should purposively benefit other stakeholders, including customers, employees, and the communities they affect (stakeholderism). At the same time, there has been an upswing of investments aligned with investors' social interests, including public equity investments in companies with high environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings and private equity 'impact investments' that typically incur greater risks than pure risk-adjusted market rate investments. This course will consider a variety of legal, ethical, and policy issues related to corporations' purposes and responsibilities, including: the meanings and measures of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and ESG criteria; disclosure of a company's environmental and social harms or risks; when is it legally and ethically appropriate for corporate managers or institutional investors to compromise shareholder value in the pursuit of social, environmental and other non-pecuniary goals; constituency statutes and benefit corporations that reflect interests other than profit maximization; the power of investors to influence corporate behavior through affirmative investments, divestments and shareholder activism; the power of various stakeholder groups to influence corporate behavior; proposals for broadening the purpose of corporations; barriers to these various practices and proposals; and whether they can be accommodated within a neoliberal framework or require a new framework.",

We will look at creating films and television programing that are artistically meaningful and/or have the potential for commercial success. The class will also look in depth at the rapidly changing business of entertainment. Films are increasingly used as a tool for social change, and we will examine this power. The entertainment industry is one of enormous importance - both from a business and cultural standpoint, and has influence on virtually every sphere of our society. Sometimes the industry can seem baffling, mercurial, and characterized more by madness than method. But despite its uncertainties, Hollywood does have its own rules, rhythms, methods and strategies - and examining and evaluating them will be a key part of this seminar. This is a time when many existing formulas are being reconsidered, retooled, or jettisoned, and new technologies and expanding markets are having a profound impact on the industry and tracking and analyzing this will be a key part of the course. I will also bring some of my professional experiences into the classroom (including directing, writing, and producing for film and television, etc.), and discuss these experiences through the intersection of the business and creative sides of the industry. We will discuss the entertainment industry's future, and address varied and effective paths for creating entertainment product with artistic and/or commercial merit. Students taking the course will be asked to be part of an in-class group exercise, and also complete a final group project where they will present their work in class.",

        "title": "Political Communication: How Leaders Become Leaders",
        "description": "This year -- 2023 -- will be a fascinating backdrop for national as well as state and local politics. Implications of the recent pandemic, its dramatic economic impacts and an uneven but recovering economy, Inflation fears, a war in Ukraine, and the looming presidential year elections in 2024 in the U.S. will continue to complicate the political landscape Politics, perhaps like no other arena, provides a rich and dramatic laboratory for studying the art and science of influential communication. Whether it is a local school bond election or a Congressional race, a Presidential debate or a State of the Union Address, the demanding communications of politics provide insights into our own strengths and gaps as communicators and leaders. Political campaigns, by their very nature, are highly visible, oriented toward very specific objectives, and increasingly leverage a variety of new media platforms. They are often emotionally charged, and rife with conflict and drama. The principles of political communications transcend politics, and are useful guides for leaders in business, the non-profit community, as well as government. How candidates, elected officials, and leaders in all kinds of organizations communicate vision, values, and experience, as well as how they perform in very fluid environments, not the least of which may be during a crisis, has a great deal to do with their career success. In its 15th year, this highly interactive course allows students to explore both theory and practice behind effective positioning and presentation. Students will analyze and evaluate both successful and unsuccessful communications strategies of political campaigns and candidates. History is a great learning tool, something emphasized throughout the class. As such students will explore historic examples of US Presidential debates, from Nixon/Kennedy to the present, as well other political events from the near and distant past. Popular culture, the effect of social media, disinformation will also be topics of discussion. Students will experience discussion of political events as they happen -- with each class drawing lessons from political developments around the nation and the world. Students will also hone their own strategic communications skills in activities requiring both written and spoken communication. This is not a course in political science, American government, or in public speaking. However, the engaged student will gain insights into those areas as well. The course is taught by David Demarest, former Vice President of Public Affairs for Stanford University. Demarest has broad communications experience across the public and private sector in financial services, education, and government. Typically, Prof. Demarest shares many of his experiences -- some successful, some less so -- through storytelling, and while those stories may be entertaining, they also provide real-life examples of communications challenges and strategies, After serving as Assistant U.S. Trade Representative, and Assistant Secretary of Labor in the Reagan Administration, in 1988 he served as Communications Director for Vice President George H. W. Bush's successful presidential campaign. He then became a member of the White House senior staff as White House Communications Director. After leaving government in 1993, he spent the next decade leading communications for two Fortune 50 companies, before coming to Stanford in 2005 to head the university's public affairs efforts.",

        "description": "GSBGEN 566 is an elective course offered to 2nd-year MBA and MSx students. The goal of this course is to improve students' judgment in confronting challenging, real business situations encountered in the normal progression of corporate activities. The course aims to sharpen moral reasoning and build judgment without favoring a particular position. The course will be taught by Mark Leslie and Peter Levine, Lecturers. The course is taught using 'vignettes'. At the beginning of each class students will be given a one-page reading that describes a business situation which requires a decision to be made.  After in-depth discussion, a second page will be handed out, describing how the situation actually unfolded and challenges the class with new information.  This new information typically changes the dynamics of the case and requires a new decision to be made.  Often there is a third and fourth page that continues the dialogue.  Frequent student-to-student and student-to-instructor role-playing will be employed in the development of the session.  Note that for most classes there is little or no advanced preparation required, which is often the case when making real-world business decisions. Cases are drawn from a wide selection of ACTUAL BUSINESS SITUATIONS with protagonists joining the class as guests whenever available.  Vignettes are based on topics such as raising venture capital, managing major industrial customers, product distribution agreements, board of director and fiduciary conflicts, developing financial instruments, palace revolt / mutiny, work/life balance, rape accusation of an executive, etc. The class is extremely engaging - it is quite usual to find continuing discussion of the day's case outside the classroom among small groups of students. This class is for two GSB credits and will be graded on a pass/fail basis. Sixty percent of the final grade will be derived from classroom performance; the remainder will be based on a final written assignment describing a personal ethical situation that the student has faced in their careers.",

The course is case/vignette-based and classes usually include frequent role-playing in authentic business, entrepreneurial, professional (e.g, consulting, law, medicine, non-profits) and other difficult interactions as was as selected interpersonal situations. Outside guests with experience relevant to the vignette theme will often participate as our guests. All students are also asked to prepare their own vignette from their own actual professional or personal experience, which will be role-played during the course. Students will be expected to attend all classes unless excused in advance. Class preparation will include reading of assigned cases/vignettes; analysis of the cases/vignettes and recommendations as to how to confront specific difficult conversations (consistent with assigned study questions); and reading of assigned background material. All students are expected to participate actively in class role plays and discussions. Grading will be on a Pass/Fail basis. MBA's and MSx's are eligible to register.",

We'll survey changes in powering vehicles (e.g. electrification and biofuels), in-vehicle connectivity and communications, and most especially changes in autonomy and self-driving vehicles. We'll examine at changes in the economics of cars, vehicles, and driving new business models, shared ownership, mobility as a service, as well as who some of the major players are in this nascent field and what they are doing/developing. And we'll explore the interactions of technology and economics with policy and broader societal changes direct effects like safety, legal liability, and who can drive; indirect effects on traffic, insurance, infrastructure needs, fuel taxes, and the environment; as well as longer-term and even bigger changes in daily life and where and how we live, work, and drive. The class is structured a bit like a large seminar. At the beginning of the quarter each student will, with the instructor, choose a topic to research. The student will interview experts on that topic and then write a memo. Most of our class sessions will be dedicated to discussing the memos written by you and your peers.",

Women from underrepresented groups experience these challenges even more acutely. GG570 Power of You: Women in Leadership will equip students with 200+ research-based strategies, tools and tactics to not only meet these workplace challenges head-on, but also create more inclusive processes, policies and cultures for the future. The course is based on the instructor's `accessible leadership' model that catalyzes students to access the leader within themselves, empower others to access their own leadership potential and create greater access through their giving. Through readings, discussions and guided, written reflections, students will deeply explore issues including, but not limited to: the likeability paradox; leadership styles and adaptivity; diversity, inclusivity, intersectionality and belonging; developing your voice and narrative; negotiation through a gendered lens; mentorship and sponsorship; family, relationships and career; resilience and self-compassion; and creating social value. Students will also write an &quot;Accessible Leadership Action Plan,&quot; which will articulate how they will lead going forward. Students will engage directly with industry leaders such as Sheryl Sandberg (Facebook), Meg Whitman (former CEO of Quibi, HP, eBay), Dr. Priscilla Chan (Chan Zuckerberg Initiative), Mary Barra (General Motors), Judy Smith (Smith &amp; Company) and Indra Nooyi (former CEO of Pepsi Co.), among others.

How is a successful path to be built by business leaders  in the midst of so much ignorance and competing narratives? This course will provide nuance and insight to students that have so far had to be content with sweeping single narratives. It is aimed at both students who have had extensive experience on the continent and those who have had no experience. Some of the lessons learnt will be applicable to other emerging markets. The course will draw upon the rich expertise and experience of business leaders who have spent their lives living and working on the continent. It will include panel discussions, frank conversations between business peers, live and written cases and vignettes.",

Many of today's philanthropic institutions operate with unprecedented innovation and influence and lead in a way that rapidly adapts to society's ever-evolving needs, issues and crises. In this course we will look at the different types of philanthropic institutions (including foundations, LLCs and corporate philanthropy) that are driving this innovation and the diverse models that shape their operations and grantmaking. We will explore how to create philanthropic strategy, investment criteria, social change goals, short-, intermediate- and long-term indicators of success as well as how each of these factors merge to drive a unique grantmaking process. Students will drill down into the best practices of grantee-centric philanthropy as well as how to comprehensively assess nonprofits, evaluate grant proposals and make strategic funding recommendations. We will hear from globally renowned and new generation philanthropic leaders implementing the most innovative and impactful approaches across issue areas including climate change, movement building, policy change, voting rights, the arts and education, all through the lens of justice. Speakers will potentially include Laura Mu&ntilde;oz Arnold (Arnold Foundation), Crystal Hayling and Ashley Clark (Libra Foundation), Hal Harvey (Energy Innovation), Justin Steele (Google.org) and Jon Stryker (Arcus Foundation). Students will engage in skill-building assignments including informal assessments of local nonprofits and a formal, written assignment that entails analyzing actual grant proposals and presenting a hypothetical funding recommendation.",

Regardless of one's age, background or profession, everyone has the potential to lead in a way that both tackles the complex social problems our interconnected world faces and creates greater inclusivity, access and impact. This demanding two-week, compressed course will provide passionate students with a brave space to develop and refine a plan for their own social change journey and amplify their potential to give, live and lead in a way that matters more. Using design thinking, students will challenge their preconceptions and wrestle with their social change approach, their privileged position as future Stanford graduates and philanthropy's role in society. Lectures and class discussions will inspire and prepare students to create social value with greater intentionality and humility. For the first class, students will submit a proposed social impact plan for their professional, philanthropic and civic lives. Over the course's six sessions, students will refine their plan, creating a formal theory of change that strategically utilizes their unique leadership platform and asset portfolio to advance opportunity and justice for a target population.

        "title": "Project You: Building and Extending your Personal Brand",
        "description": "GSB Graduates will be entering and re-entering the workforce needing to know and understand how to build, broadcast, maintain and protect their personal brand. Project You will help each student realize: What is a personal brand and how can it be unleashed as a valuable, competitive advantage? Why do you need a personal brand?  How do you differentiate yourself and create a brand identity and strategy? How do you use social and traditional media to enhance your brand effectively as well as measure the metrics of social media responses? And how do you know when to pivot and evolve your brand for sustainability? GSB Lecturer, Allison Kluger, a former Television Executive and Co-Lecturer, Tyra Banks, Supermodel/Entrepreneur/Television Executive/Business CEO, will lead this class.  They will help students create their own specific image to support their brand, teach them how to navigate on-air exposure, and help them create a long-term strategy for how to promote their personal brand across several media platforms. Within a highly interactive learning environment, image transformations, live broadcasting of presentations at a television station, live streaming of portions of the class on Facebook Live, and YouTube recordings of presentations will all be part of the assignments and requirements. The class culminates with the students sharing their honed personal brand to the public via three viable platforms (Facebook Live, local television, YouTube) to jump-start their personal brand extension. A 1:30 video stating &quot;Who you are, what your personal brand is, and what you want it to be&quot; will be a mandatory requirement before Class #1.",

        "title": "Policy Practicum:  Alabama Innovation",
        "description": "Client: Innovate Alabama, https://innovatealabama.org/.  The newly established Alabama Innovation Commission, known as Innovate Alabama, has sought policy recommendations from a group of faculty at Stanford University, including representatives from Stanford Law School and the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The goal of the Alabama Innovation Commission is to identify and present to policymakers policies that will promote innovation, entrepreneurship, economic development, and high-skilled jobs in the state. In this policy lab, students will work on papers whose results will be incorporated with attribution into the recommendations provided to the Commission and the Governor. Where possible, projects will be conducted in partnership with students at the major research universities in Alabama. Available topics for projects include building on the state's existing competencies in medical research and space and defense technology; assessing financial incentives for attracting businesses; deploying broadband-based education; fostering the role of universities in economic development; and drawing high-skilled workers through opportunities for outdoor recreation.  Students admitted to the lab will work on one of the following projects (to be determined according to the priorities of the client):  1.) Business Incentives and Prosperity. High profile competitions for the headquarters of large corporations often lead states to offer large incentive packages. States that land the deal are often perceived as the winners. Some recruitment initiatives indeed bring substantial local economic benefits, yet recent research has called into question many commonly-held beliefs about state incentives. Such incentives often may have costs that exceed benefits, and there is some question even as to whether they increase local economic activity at the margin in most cases. This project will evaluate Alabama's existing incentives for attracting businesses and make recommendations based on the successes and failures of recent incentive programs around the country. The project will weigh the potential for traditional recruitment tactics such as tax incentives and subsidized industrial sites against alternatives such as infrastructure development, skills development programs, and customized business services. (S. Haber and J. Rauh).  2.) Deploying Broadband-Based Education. The future of Alabama rests on the talent and knowledge of its citizens so the success of K-12 public education must be a potent driver of human capital development.  The work of the Stanford-AL team will look at the current and potential for deploying broadband-based education throughout the state to augment the current capacities of K-12 educators to deliver high quality instruction, especially in the priority areas of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) which ties in closely to economic development plans for the state. (M. Raymond).  3.) Fostering the Role of Universities. It is widely recognized that universities are key to the development of innovative economic activity at the state and local level. The most productive local innovation economies in the US have emerged in locations such as Silicon Valley, North Carolina's Research Triangle, and the Boston area, powered by research that has emerged from local universities. Success stories of the impact of universities on the innovative ecosystem also abound in smaller markets in recent decades. This project will aim to make specific, concrete recommendations for state government policy to build on the strength of Alabama's universities to grow Alabama's technology and innovation economy. (R. Banks and J. Rauh).  4.) The Outdoor Recreation Lab. Persuading someone to move thousands of miles to a new home, a new community, and a new state is not an event; it is a process. It often starts with a short visit that plants a seed in a person's mind. Those crucial, initial, short visits often occur because of tourism; and when it comes to people who have invested in human capital that is specific to high technology industries, that tourism tends to be focused on outdoor recreation. Outdoor recreation tourism is not, however, simply a way to draw high-skilled workers into a state; it is also a way to share the economic rents generated by high tech industries with rural areas. It is the working hypothesis of the Outdoor Recreation Lab that Alabama's Cumberland Plateau has necessary environmental characteristics to be a draw for high tech workers and entrepreneurs/and thus be an important part of building and sustaining a more innovative Alabama economy--but that potential has not been fully developed. The purpose of the Outdoor Recreation Lab is to assess the hypothesis that the Cumberland Plateau is an underdeveloped resource for the State of Alabama. Specifically, the lab will assess its natural endowments as compared to its physical and business infrastructure. An important component of this assessment is the extent of public lands, the interpretation of &quot;public trust&quot; in Alabama law regarding access to navigable rivers and streams, and the number and identity of agencies that would have to be coordinated to provide access to those lands and waterways.  It will also learn about the attempts--both successful and not--by other states to leverage natural endowments to generate in-migration by tech workers and entrepreneurs. (S. Haber).  Additional sub-projects if students are interested may include deep dives into how Alabama can build on existing competencies in Medical Research and in Space/Defense technology to foster the further development of its economy and technology center.  The lab seeks students from the law and business schools, the graduate MS&amp;E program, and other graduate students with a background in entrepreneurship and/or local governance. Students who have ties to Alabama are especially invited to apply.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Performance, Class Participation, Written Assignments.  Cross-listed with the Law School.

        "description": "The last few years we have created significant challenges and opportunities in education; there has never been a more pressing and urgent need in our history to foster entrepreneurship in education by leveraging new technologies. This course will help you develop the skills and strategies necessary to effectively create and evaluate educational services and education technology startups much like educators, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, and venture capital investors do. Some questions we will discuss include: How do entrepreneurs, educators, and VCs evaluate and grow successful education and edtech startups? Why do most startups in edtech fail, and what are the key ingredients for success, especially in today's challenging times? What does it take to get venture capital financing in edtech? Each week will feature a different edtech entrepreneur as a guest speaker; these leaders hail from a variety of innovative for-profit and non-profit education technology startups. As we hear from the speakers, we'll evaluate all aspects of their invention, particularly in the context of emerging distance learning and hybrid learning trends. A fundamental question we'll explore in this course is how educators and technologists can better collaborate to leverage the scale and impact of technology to improve educational equity and access. This course will be taught in person; attendance at each session is required. Juniors, Seniors and graduate students of all Stanford schools are welcome.

        "description": "Complex interactions among governments, businesses, and other institutions such as media, non-governmental, and international organizations, shape our world and our lives. In this course we will explore the workings of these interactions and the challenges they present for societies around the globe. As specific examples, we will discuss the 21st century economic and political forces affecting internet governance, global supply chains, and the workings of different legal systems. We will see how the competence and integrity of people and institutions, their respect of human rights, and the structure and effectiveness of governance and accountability mechanisms in the private and the public sectors, are key determinants of the outcomes. At one extreme, people and institutions may be highly effective but lack concern for human rights. At the other extreme, compassionate individuals and institutions might be ineffective or incompetent. It is also a truism that power can corrupt and may be abused. In fact, standard success metrics in business and in government, combined with weak governance mechanisms, may encourage and enable such abuse. The course will challenge you to consider your own roles as business leaders and as citizens, and your opportunities to help create trustworthy institutions and markets.",

        "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to drive us towards a better future for all of humanity, but it also comes with significant risks and challenges. At its best, AI can help humans mitigate climate change, diagnose and treat diseases more effectively, enhance learning, and improve access to capital throughout the world. But it also has the potential to exacerbate human biases, destroy trust in information flow, displace entire industries, and amplify inequality throughout the world. We have arrived at a pivotal moment in the development of the technology in which we must establish a foundation for how we will design AI to capture the positive potential and mitigate the negative risks. To do this, we must be intentional about human-centered design because, 'Only once we have thought hard about what sort of future we want, will we be able to begin steering a course toward a desirable future. If we don't know what we want, we're unlikely to get it.' Thus, building AI must be an inclusive, interactive, and introspective process guided by an affirmative vision of a beneficial AI-future. The goal of this interdisciplinary class is to bridge the gap between technological and societal objectives: How do we design AI to promote human well-being?  The ultimate aim is to provide tools and frameworks to build a more harmonious human society based on cooperation toward a shared vision. Thus, students are trained in basic science to understand what brings about the conditions for human flourishing and will create meaningful AI technologies that aligns with the PACE framework:&middot;has a clear and meaningful purpose  &middot;augments human dignity and autonomy &middot;creates a feeling of inclusivity and collaboration&middot; creates shared prosperity and a sense of forward movement (excellence)Toward this end, students work in interdisciplinary teams on a final project and propose a solution that tackles a significant societal challenge by leveraging technology and frameworks on human thriving.",

        "description": "Humans are remarkably generous.  Americans, for instance, donate roughly 3% of GDP to charity and volunteer over 4% of hours worked.  Yet, our generosity is replete with quirks.  We are highly sensitive to whether a gift originates with us--and especially whether its seen originating with us--but care less about whether the gift was needed or impactful.  Indeed, highly ineffective charities persist for decades even in the presence of far more effective alternatives engaged in identical activities.  The same people who are quick to give when asked are even quicker to 'avoid the ask' or take advantage of a plausible excuse.  And, we often care deeply not just whether someone did a good turn but their motive for doing it.  We'll discuss the origins of human generosity and its accompanying quirks, and also develop practical takeaways in the form of guidance for the design of interventions to motivate more altruistic behaviors.  The class draws upon a diversity of literatures and methods, including evolutionary dynamics, game theory, survey experiments, and field experiments.  Expect weekly readings and to present about these readings in class, a handful of optional problem sets, and a final project in which you incorporate some of the course material into your research via e.g., a literature review, a novel experiment design, or a novel intervention.",

        "description": "This course introduces students to the role of theory-based structural econometric models in i) estimating determinants of behavior from revealed preference data, ii) evaluating counterfactual decisions or policies by firms, organizations and/or the government and iii) assessing identification when using descriptive or &quot;model-free&quot; approaches to inference.  It begins with discrete choice models applied in consumer choice contexts, then extends those models to consider state-dependence, forward-looking dynamics and equilibrium peer effects.  A focus throughout is the role of heterogeneity for both identification and firm decisions.  The class also considers simulation-based estimation and empirical pricing or advertising models.  The emphasis is on an intuitive understanding and coding and estimation of entry-level models of consumer behavior.",

        "description": "This seminar examines research on the psychology of judgment and choice. Although the normative issue of how decisions should be made is relevant, the descriptive issue of how decisions are made is the main focus of the course. Topics of discussion include choice, judgment heuristics and biases, decision framing, prospect theory, mental accounting, context effects, task effects, regret, and other topics. The goal of the seminar is twofold: to foster a critical appreciation of existing knowledge in behavioral decision theory, to develop the students' skills in identifying and testing interesting research ideas, and to explore research opportunities for adding to that knowledge.",

        "description": "The purpose of the course is to (a) introduce graduate students to questions and methods in the rapidly evolving fields of climate/sustainable finance; (b) connect researchers from across the globe interested in this topic to stimulate more rigorous, relevant, and collaborative work. Addressing climate change demands changes in natural, social, and economic systems and will require greater collaboration. In that spirit, this course is being offered by a team of professors from different schools and universities across the globe. Each instructor will deliver one or more lectures and there will be students from a number of different schools. Our teaching group consists of current and former AFA and EFA presidents and some of the leading climate finance scholars, including Laura Starks (current AFA President), Patrick Bolton (former AFA President), Stefano Giglio, Marcin Kacperczyk (former EFA President), Caroline Flammer, Geoff Heal, Stefan Reichelstein, Ben Caldecott and Peter Tufano. Pre-requisites and finance context: The course will assume that participants have a background in core graduate-level finance. The course will cover topics from a variety of subfields in finance (asset pricing, financial intermediation, household finance, corporate finance).  The introductory block of three classes is intended to orient students to the science of climate change as well as to refresh key concepts from economics and finance; the remaining classes will dive into detail on current research in different subfield.  We will conclude with a discussion of open topics in this field.  We expect that the course will be useful to doctoral students in finance, economics, and accounting.  As a global class, we will largely be on Zoom. Beyond weekly preparation and participation, students will be expected to write a paper either laying out a potential research topic or synthesizing a set of related papers that were not discussed in class.",
