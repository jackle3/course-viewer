        "description": "This three-quarter sequence asks big questions of major texts in the European and American tradition.  What is a good life?  How should society be organized?  Who belongs?  How should honor, love, sin, and similar abstractions govern our actions?  What duty do we owe to the past and future?  The second quarter focuses on the transition from the Middle Ages to Modernity, Europe's re-acquaintance with classical antiquity and its first contacts with the New World. Authors include Dante, Shakespeare, Machiavelli, Cervantes, and Milton. N.B. This is the second of three courses in the European track. These courses offer an unparalleled opportunity to study European history and culture, past and present. Take all three to experience a year-long intellectual community dedicated to exploring how ideas have shaped our world and future. Students who take HUMCORE 11 and HUMCORE 12Q will have preferential admission to HUMCORE 13Q (a WR2 seminar).",

        "title": "Spanish Through Poetry",
        "description": "This Spanish poetry course is designed for intermediate and advanced speakers who have an interest in environmental issues. It examines how poetry reflects and reimagines the environment, specifically in Latin America, from the 70s to the present. The course explores different aesthetic and theoretical approaches to poetry related to nature, ecopoetry, postnatural poetry, and poetry of place. Students will analyze and discuss various types of poetry, including single and collective poems, serial poetry, and multimedia poems. These may include Cecilia, Vicun?a?s SemiYa (Chile); C&iquest;sar Vallejo?s &quot;Los mineros salieron de la mina&quot; (Per&iquest;); Esthela Calder&iquest;n?s Soplo de corriente vital (Nicaragua); Exequiel Zaidenwerg?s &quot;&iquest;Qu&iquest; es la poes&iquest;a? (Yo es Nosotrxs)&quot; (Argentina); Humedal: poema a cuatro manos (collective poem, Wetlands Argentina); Lorenzo Sandoval?s Aquel Verano del 22 (Spain); Nicanor Parra?s ecopoemas (Chile); Ra&iquest;l Zurita?s &quot;Escritos en el cielo&quot; and &quot;Ni pena ni miedo&quot; (Chile); Roxana Miranda Rupailaf?s Shumpall (text and video-poem) (Wallmapu); Ver&iquest;nica Gerber Bicecci?s Otro d&iquest;a? (poemas sint&iquest;ticos) (M&iquest;xico); Yolanda Pant&iquest;n?s &quot;Deslave&quot; (Venezuela). In this genre, we will explore how environmental concerns are expressed through formal language and imagery. We will examine whether poetic devices obscure or reveal environmental inquiries and how language can highlight power dynamics and promote environmental consciousness. We will delve deeply into the formal aspects of language and the material processes involved in creating environmental poetic imagery, and we will connect poetry to environmental activism. Students must also enroll in the related course SPANLANG 103 &quot;Concurrent Writing Support&quot; for language learning.",

It makes use of an archaeology of knowledge to find traces in the past for ideas and practices common in our present. We will explore in this course some of the ideas and devices that foreshadowed, during the Middle Ages and Early Modernity, the field of computation. We will also explore the different uses that were given or were meant to be given to these ideas and devices. In this journey, we will discover how different cultures created, used, or imagined different devices for computation. Some of the topics that we will cover are: al-Khwarizmi's algebra, al-Jazari's clocks, Raymond Llull's combinatorial diagrams, Peruvian Quipus, and Leibniz's binary numbers. Our focus is cultural, philosophical, and historical, the course will not involve programming and knowing how to program is not a prerequisite. Taught in English.",

Possible authors include Gloria Anzald&uacute;a, Macarena G&oacute;mez-Barris, Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, and Jos&eacute; Eustasio Rivera. We will consider the ethics and politics of climate change in the Americas, how the methodologies of literary and decolonial studies can generate insights into contemporary climate change impacts in Latin America, and what role culture has in a period defined by chronic and slow-moving environmental crisis and recovery.

At the end of this course, you will have read and studied this work in its entirety. Close to 1000 pages long, Roberto Bola&ntilde;o's opus is both daunting and eminently readable&iquest;a feast for serious readers and aspiring writers. It is a dark thriller that spans several continents, with memorable characters and unsuspected plot twists throughout. Similar to Anna Karenina or One Hundred Years of Solitude in ambition, it explores the limits of the sayable, and of the novel form. Its protagonists include vivacious young people, a lost German author, an African-American journalist in Mexico, gallivanting academics, and bodily remains. Some of its topics include literary fame and influence, exile, Cartel violence, and the legacies of World War II. Take this course if you would like to gain solid training in the art of close reading, take your Spanish to the next level, immerse yourself in deep learning, familiarize yourself with current events in Latin America, and participate in a dedicated book salon. The reading pace is very moderate (20 pages every weekday), which allows for careful consideration and readerly enjoyment. The analytical skills you gain in this seminar are also highly portable: they will serve you well in all of your future scholarly pursuits. The course combines small seminar discussion&iquest;a staple of humanities education&iquest;with an approximation to a fresh, contemporary text. You will present on a small section of the book, write short response papers, and engage in various creative activities. Guest speakers and archival work will complement our regular activities.",

        "description": "Do you like &quot;Narcos&quot; on Netflix and want to learn more about the Drug Wars and its representation? Are you curious about Colombia? The present sophomore seminar serves the double purpose of introducing you to Colombian culture and of training you in sophisticated rhetorical analysis. At the end of the course you will be a better reader and writer (in Spanish, no less!). You will also have familiarity with a country that in some ways is a &quot;meta-Latin American country,&quot; for it includes the regional cultures of the Caribbean, Pacific, Andes, plains, and Amazon jungle. We will read fascinating novels that deal with the sugar plantation economy in the 19th century, the exploitation of rubber at the onset of the 20th, and the coffee and cocaine booms leading to the present. Some things to expect: gripping, tragic love stories among the landed elites of the Pacific Coast, and among their slaves, set against the backdrop of a landscape forever transformed by agriculture (La Mar&iacute;a); dangerous adventures of city-dwellers turned jungle explorers (La Vor&aacute;gine),  a strike among banana workers turned supernatural catastrophe (Cien a&ntilde;os de soledad); the criminal legacy of Pablo Escobar, a man who built an empire of coca leaf, as a symptom of broader societal problems (La par&aacute;bola de Pablo). This rare course offering will allow you to gain granular knowledge about a fascinating body of literature. You will also become acquainted with an exciting method of cultural analysis called &quot;new materialism.&quot; Taught in Spanish.",

Would a white-presenting person with one Black grandmother be eligible for university admissions through Brazil&iquest;s socioeconomic and racial quotas? In this seminar style IntroSem, we will explore these questions through an investigation of whiteness and white supremacy in the Americas, with a focus on Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, the Southern Cone, and the US and the Latinx community. Through in-class discussions and collaborative curation projects, we will analyze historical documents, current events, films, and, yes, Twitter debates, to think critically about whiteness in Latin America, how it relates to discourses of racial democracy, and how its ambiguity perpetuates national and regional identities founded on anti-Indigenous and anti-Black racism. You will engage with a wide range of methodological approaches to studying whiteness, including ethnography and psychology, as well as theoretical traditions like Black feminism and decoloniality. Your multidisciplinary final projects will showcase the skills you develop in using historical and cultural analysis as an entry point to examine and compare the different ways in which whiteness works throughout the Americas.

Defined as a break with the past and with tradition, the term &quot;modernism&quot; in Latin America has signified specific transformations that speak to the continent&iquest;s long history of colonialism and alleged marginality in relation to Europe and the United States. How have Latin American artistic and literary movements drawn from and broken with European modernisms and avant-gardes? What meanings of &quot;tradition&quot; and &quot;modernity&quot; emerge from their works, especially in their engagement with Indigenous and Afro-Latin American cultures? By examining artworks together with literary texts, we will address their aesthetic dimensions, as well as the socio-historical and political conditions that made them possible. Some movements may include Antropofagia (Brazil), Mexican Muralism, Surrealism, Indigenisms, Afro-Caribbean art and literature, Abstractionism, Neo-Concretism, and Tropicalia.

How did the distinct nations and cultures of Latin America develop out of Spain and Portugal's former territories? The foundational, tumultuous period from the mid-eighteenth to the mid-twentieth century witnessed rebellions and revolts; independence and abolition; liberal reforms and revolutions; urbanization and the consolidation of national cultures. Students will give special consideration to the formation of political bodies in the nineteenth century and cultural identities in the twentieth century, all while considering the strategic means by which these processes effectively excluded or included large sectors of the population. Knowledge of this period in the region is crucial to understanding the world today. Taught in Spanish.",

Beyond Brazil, there are tens of millions of Portuguese speakers in Africa and Europe as well as smaller communities in Asia and North America. In this course, students will learn about the cultures and communities that make up the Portuguese-speaking world, even as they learn to critique the idea of linking these communities by means of a language that became global (like Spanish and English) through violent colonial expansion.

How do we go about reading the presence of social contexts within cultural texts? How do ethno-racial writers re-imagine the nation as a site with many &quot;cognitive maps&quot; in which the nation-state is not congruent with cultural identity?  How do diaspora and border narratives/texts strive for comparative theoretical scope while remaining rooted in specific local histories.

In the arts, the turn of the century launched a period of great aesthetic invention. Considering the singular place of Cuba in Latin America, the Caribbean, and the globe, this course addresses some of the most representative works of Cuban literature and film since independence until the present time. Special attention will be given to Afrocubanismo, ethnographic literature, the avant-garde aesthetics of the group Or&iacute;genes, Marvelous Realism, testimony, revolution, socialist experimental film, diaspora, the Special Period, and post-Soviet life.

We will examine closely the ways in which such poetry registers environmental degradation and its disproportionate impacts along axes of race, gender, and class.  How does such poetry unearth a history of colonialism and extractivism that continues to manifest socio-politically and economically in the Latin American landscape?  What futures do these eco-poets imagine and advocate?  In its encounter with the natural world, poetry makes us feel:  how might it inspire us to act?

While exploring each place in a particular historical moment, we will also consider the relations between culture, power, and social life. How does the cultural life of a country intersect with the political activity of a capital? How do large cities shape our everyday experience, our aesthetic preferences, and our sense of history? Why do some cities become cultural capitals? Primary materials for this course will consist of literary, visual, sociological, and historical documents (in translation); authors we will read include Boccaccio, Dante, Sor Juana, Montesquieu, Baudelaire, Gogol, Irmgard Keun, Freud, and Borges.

We know of structures such as the sonnet and the sestina, but what about the corrido, ghazal, haiku, jintishi, landay, lira, l&iquest;c b&aacute;t, qa&iquest;&iquest;da, pantoum, romance, rondeau, sijo, than-bauk, and triolet? How might we reimagine poetic forms in English by looking to the past at home and abroad?In this poetry workshop, you will write an original poem each week. Assigned readings will illustrate the development of specific forms from language traditions around the world and the ways in which they've crossed into English-language poetry. Previous experience with creative writing not required.",

We'll also ask whether a disenchanted world can be re-enchanted; when, if ever, the truth stops being the most important thing; why we sometimes choose to read sad stories; whether we ever love someone for who they are; who could possibly want to live their same life over and over again; what it takes to make ourselves fully moral; whether it's ever good to be conflicted; how we can pull ourselves together; and how we can take ourselves apart.

This class engages these questions to explore the origins, development, and centrality of Afro-Brazilian culture. We will immerse ourselves in the cities of Salvador and Rio de Janeiro, explore samba and Carnaval, take a dive into syncretic religious practices such as Candombl&eacute;, observe dances like capoeira, and study literary and artistic expressions from an anti-racist perspective to gain a fuller picture of Brazilian society today.

Along with the fall of centuries-old empires, World War I brought about the collapse of traditional European values and the dissociation of the subject. The aestheticizing of violence and the ensuing insecurity inaugurated the society of totally administered life, based on universal suspicion and pervasive guilt. The seminar will study narrative responses to these developments in some of the foremost authors of the 20th century from several European literatures: Knut Hamsun, Joseph Roth, Ernst J&uuml;nger, Virginia Woolf, Franz Kafka, Curzio Malaparte, Thomas Mann, Merc&egrave; Rodoreda, Antonio Lobo Antunes, and Jaume Cabr&eacute;.

Is myth a universal language or is it a set of cultural dialects? In this seminar myth will be approached from several directions: its classic distinction from logos, its relation to history, its underwriting of ideology, its anthropological applications, and its contemporary uses in advertising. We will consider modern cases of popular myths, in particular the complementary figures of erotic seduction: Carmen (the femme fatale) and Don Juan.",

How did different ideas about modernity, subjection, and revolution emerge and interact with one another in literary texts, visual artifacts, and legal documents throughout Cuban history? How does a conceptual history of these terms look like if we center the island's political, artistic, scientific, and religious movements? How does Cuba and its history inform our own ideas about freedom, slavery, and racial relations? While addressing these questions, we will also reflect on the island's past and present position in relation to other parts of the Caribbean, the Americas, and the Atlantic world. Ultimately, this course aims to challenge and historicize the most common connotations attributed to modernity, subjection, and revolution by examining not only European-based philosophical thought, but also cultural objects and discourses produced within the specific contexts of Cuba and the Caribbean.

In his work he engaged with avantgarde poets like Paul &Eacute;luard, Antonin Artaud and Tristan Tzara, the post-colonial philosopher and psychiatrist Frantz Fanon and philosopher F&eacute;lix Guattari. His project was shaped by radical politics in Catalonia during the 1930s and his own practice of treating the therapeutic community rather than the patients themselves. Tosquelles worked with people outside the medical profession: musicians, writers, lawyers and even prostitutes. These experiences resonate in the book he wrote on poet Gabriel Ferrater and the Spanish Civil War. Taught in English.",

The pictographic codices that celebrated the expansive Aztec Empire were created after its fall; and the conquistadors' indigenous allies painted some of the most triumphalist narratives of the conquest. Friars accused indigenous peoples of &quot;idolatry&quot; both to justify the destruction of their images and objects, and to construct legal defenses of their humanity. Colonial authorities frequently claimed Afro-Catholic festivals were seditious. In light of such complexity, official histories that recount the top-down consolidation of royal and viceroyal power are suspiciously simple. What counter-narratives do images and other visual phenomena from this tumultuous period offer? This course introduces students to major texts from Colonial Mexico (royal chronicles, conquistadors' tales, letters, poems, festival accounts) alongside a fascinating trove of images (painted codices with Nahuatl texts, feather mosaics, and indigenous heraldry) and considers how experiences of images and spectacles were transformed into textual accounts (&quot;ekphrasis&quot; or the literary device of description). Taught in Spanish with accommodations for non-ILAC students who are still improving their language skills",

        "description": "This course takes students on a journey through tales of getting lost in the Portuguese and Spanish empires. We will read harrowing stories of being caught adrift at sea and mystical interpretations of island desertion. The course begins with sea-dominated stories of Portuguese voyages to Asia, Africa, and Brazil then turns to how the Amazon and the sert&atilde;o, or backlands, became a driving force of Brazilian literature. Official historians, poets, and novelists imbued the ocean and the backlands with romanticism, yet these spaces were the backdrop to slavery and conquest. Instead of approaching shipwreck and captivity narratives as eyewitness testimonies, as many have, we will consider how they produced 'the sea' and 'the wilderness' as poetic constructions in Western literature while also offering glimpses of the 'darker side' of Iberian expansion. Taught in English with all texts offered both in English and the original Portuguese or Spanish. Optional guest lectures in Portuguese.",

I will establish a map of avant-garde narrative considering the plurality of its expressions and temporalities, the proposals for renewal or rupture and the interest in readjusting its character to the sensitivity of the new. We will focus on the study the avant-garde narrative that operates with small scenarios, common and strangers, closer to everyday life, treating trivial issues, recreating the disputes around the relationships between experience and narration. We will also work on the formats of the detective story, science fiction, and the fables of modern artists and their links with modernity to understand how in avant-garde narratives, the referential world is transformed into oneiric materiality. We will discuss works by Teresa de la Parra, Arqueles Vela, Pablo Palacio, Julio Garmendia, Efr&eacute;n Hern&aacute;ndez, Felisberto Hern&aacute;ndez, Roberto Arlt, Jos&eacute; Mart&iacute;nez Sotomayor, Mar&iacute;a Luisa Bombal, Jorge Luis Borges, Armon&iacute;a Sommers, Jes&uacute;s Enrique Lossada, Marta Brunet and Vicente Huidobro.

Argentine, Brazilian, Chilean, Colombian, and Cuban essayism and visual arts from the mid 20th century to the present, notably origenismo, neo-baroque, and indigenismo. In collaboration with a cognate course at UC Berkeley. Taught in Spanish.nNOTE: This course must be taken for a minimum of 3 units and a letter grade to be eligible for WAYS credit.",

        "description": "The conquerors, missionaries, and historians who reflected on Iberian overseas expansion during the early modern period often asked themselves a crucial question: was there only one world or many? Were the Americas a 'New World,' unknown to the ancients, entirely detached from the rest of human history? Even after the invasion and occupation of the Americas, many European chroniclers continued to think that the world was divided into three parts - Europe, Asia, and Africa. In their descriptions of the Americas, they drew heavily on histories and travel reports pertaining to other epochs and locales, especially contemporary Asia and ancient Rome. At the same time, indigenous elites and mestizo authors in the Americas used 'Old World' history and news of distant conflicts to reflect on the immediacy of their historical experience. In this course, students will consider the ways in which diverse authors in New Spain (Mexico), Peru, and Brazil contemplated themselves in relation to remote times and places: from Greco-Roman Antiquity to Lutheran Germany, the Ottoman Mediterranean to the Apocalyptic End of Times. Students will analyze the many reflections, distortions, inversions, translations, uncanny resemblances, and strange parallel dimensions that resulted from these intellectual experiments. Primary sources include chronicles, poetry, theater, Afro-Catholic festivals, pictographic codices, feather mosaics, and maps. All texts offered in the original language and in English translation whenever possible. For graduate students and advanced undergraduates.",

In this bilingual course we will explore figurations of madness, mental illnesses, and other kinds of crises of the self in Latin American cultural objects, from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries. We will examine testimonies of religious experiences, novels, medical treatises, short stories, intimate diaries, and visual materials on disorderly states of mind and fragmented identities produced in territories that are today Cuba, Brazil, Mexico, Per&uacute;, Argentina, and the Dominican Republic, among others. In our examination of these objects and their historical contexts, we will discuss how colonial and state authorities have used psychiatric labels to control and regulate the lives of Afro-descendants and women in Latin American territories. We will also examine the ways in which men and women of color navigated through these labels in order to evade punishment, engage in creative processes, or simply live their lives.

        "description": "To the rhythm of Latin trap and K-Pop, a new generation of artists portrays the youth cultures that revolutionize contemporary Latin America: Juli Delgado (Colombia), Claudia Huaquimilla (Chile), and Ioshua (Argentina), among others. From a selection of movies, plays, and short stories produced by these emerging artists, we will delve into the strategies deployed by Latin American teenagers to face the challenges of a convulsed present: forced migration, labor exploitation, racial violence, and sexual discrimination.

        "description": "This course explores gossip, rumor, and hearsay in cultures and histories of the Hispanic world. From asserting hegemonic moral values to organizing subversive movements and uprisings; from intrusions in people's private lives to community building, gossip, rumors, and hearsay have helped produce worlds and knowledge in different periods of Spanish and Latin American histories. We will examine plays, novels, short stories, historical documents, telenovelas, and other cultural objects from the seventeenth to the twentieth century in which chisme - or its cousins murmuraci&iquest;n, rumor, and ciza&iquest;a - operates as a device that either helps maintain or destabilize power relations. In doing so, we will consider  the role of gossip, rumor, and hearsay in narrative-making; the multiple definitions of chisme and the values associated with it in different historical periods, as well as the relationship between rumors and official or &quot;legitimate&quot; sources of information. Ultimately, we aim to address questions such as the following: How did chisme become such a fundamental feature in different Latin American cultures? What are the tropes and stereotypes associated with gossip, and what are their histories? Are we readers of literature mere chismosos? In addressing these questions, we will also confront matters related to orality, trustworthiness, intimacy, race, and gender. Classes will be a mixture of short lectures, discussions, student presentations, and conversations with invited scholars. Taught in Spanish. Students must have taken SPANLANG 13 or equivalent.",

Why did Andr&eacute; Breton, Paul &Eacute;luard and Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca visit Barcelona? Moreover, why did Catalonia become such an important cradle for Surrealism? Why is the (Catalan) landscape such a relevant presence in the work of Mir&oacute; and Dal&iacute;? Through a critical analysis and discussion of selected works of art and literature, this seminar focuses and follows the trajectories of Mir&oacute; and Dal&iacute;, from Barcelona to Paris to New York, and explores the role of their Catalan background as a potentially essential factor in their own contributions to Surrealism and the reception of their work. The course will provide the materials and guide the student to conduct research on a specific work(s) of art, architecture, literature or cinema either by Mir&oacute;, Dal&iacute; or one of his peers in relation to their cultural, social and political context. The course is intended for graduate students in Iberian and Comparative Literature, Art History, Cultural Studies, and related fields. Taught in English by Jordi Falg&agrave;s i Casanovas.",

This proliferation of history writing was complicated by the fact that the various populations of the global Iberian monarchies, particularly those of New Spain, Peru, and Brazil, did not share the same concepts of historicity or temporality. In this course, students will explore a great diversity of primary sources (chronicles, reports, annals, pictographic codices, theater, paintings, feather mosaics, murals, etc.) and discover the unexpected social memories and theories of history that they created.",

        "description": "How did images maintain, construct, or transform political power during the conquest and colonization of Mexico? The creation and destruction of visual materials in this period had a complicated relationship with power. The pictographic codices that celebrated the expansive Aztec Empire were created after its fall; and the conquistadors' indigenous allies painted some of the most triumphalist narratives of the conquest. Friars accused indigenous peoples of &quot;idolatry&quot; both to justify the destruction of their images and objects, and to construct legal defenses of their humanity. Colonial authorities frequently claimed Afro-Catholic festivals were seditious. In light of such complexity, official histories that recount the top-down consolidation of royal and viceroyal power are suspiciously simple. What counter-narratives do images and other visual phenomena from this tumultuous period offer? This course introduces students to major texts from Colonial Mexico (royal chronicles, conquistadors' tales, letters, poems, festival accounts) alongside a fascinating trove of images (painted codices with Nahuatl texts, feather mosaics, and indigenous heraldry) and considers how experiences of images and spectacles were transformed into textual accounts (&quot;ekphrasis&quot; or the literary device of description).

We will read harrowing stories of being caught adrift at sea and mystical interpretations of island desertion. The course begins with sea-dominated stories of Portuguese voyages to Asia, Africa, and Brazil then turns to how the Amazon and the sert&atilde;o, or backlands, became a driving force of Brazilian literature. Official historians, poets, and novelists imbued the ocean and the backlands with romanticism, yet these spaces were the backdrop to slavery and conquest. Instead of approaching shipwreck and captivity narratives as eyewitness testimonies, as many have, we will consider how they produced 'the sea' and 'the wilderness' as poetic constructions in Western literature while also offering glimpses of the 'darker side' of Iberian expansion. Taught in English with all texts offered both in English and the original Portuguese or Spanish. Optional guest lectures in Portuguese.",

        "title": "One World or Many? Representing Distance, Time, and Place in Iberian Expansion",
        "description": "The travelers, missionaries, and historians that reflected on Iberian overseas expansion during the early modern period often asked themselves a crucial question: was there only one world or many? Could the New World, unknown to the ancients, be entirely detached from the rest of human history? Many of these chroniclers continued to think that the world was divided into three parts: Europe, Asia, and Africa. In their descriptions of the Americas, they drew heavily on histories and travel reports pertaining to other epochs and locales, especially contemporary Asia and ancient Rome. Local authors and artists in the New World in this period used world history and news of distant conflicts to reflect on the immediacy of their historical experience. In this course, we will consider the ways in which historians, conquistadors, missionaries, and indigenous authors in New Spain (Mexico), Brazil, and Peru contemplated themselves in the looking glass of remote times and places: from Greco-Roman Antiquity to Lutheran Germany, from the Ottoman Mediterranean to the Apocalyptic End of Times. Students will reassess the importance of this archive to early modern studies writ large and challenge the scholarly tendency to frame the Iberian Peninsula as the center and the Americas as the periphery. Primary sources will include sixteenth and seventeenth-century chronicles, reports, poetry, theater, pictographic codices, feather mosaics, and maps. Reading knowledge of Spanish and a willingness to work with Portuguese required. Course to be taught by Nicole T. Hughes.",

        "description": "A border is a force of containment that inspires dreams of being overcome, crossed, and cursed; motivates bodies to climb over walls; and threatens physical harm. This graduate seminar places into comparative dialogue a variety of perspectives from Chicana/o and Mexican/Latin American literary studies. Our seminar will examine fiction and cultural productions that range widely, from celebrated Mexican and Chicano authors such as Carlos Fuentes (La frontera de cristal), Yuri Herrera (Se&ntilde;ales que precederan al fin del mundo), Willivaldo Delgaldillo (La Virgen del Barrio &Aacute;rabe), Am&eacute;rico Paredes (George Washington G&oacute;mez: A Mexico-Texan Novel), Gloria Anzald&uacute;a (Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza), and Sandra Cisneros (Carmelo: Puro Cuento), among others, to musicians whose contributions to border thinking and culture have not yet been fully appreciated such as Herb Albert, Ely Guerra, Los Tigres del Norte, and Caf&eacute; Tacvba. Last but not least, we will screen and analyze Orson Welles' iconic border films Touch of Evil and Rodrigo Dorfman's Los Sue&ntilde;os de Ang&eacute;lica. Proposing a diverse and geographically expansive view of the US-Mexico border literary and cultural studies, this seminar links the work of these authors and musicians to struggles for land and border-crossing rights, anti-imperialist forms of trans-nationalism, and to the decolonial turn in border thinking or pensamineto fronterizo. It forces us to take into account the ways in which shifts in the nature of global relations affect literary production and negative aesthetics especially in our age of (late) post-industrial capitalism.

        "description": "The conquerors, missionaries, and historians who reflected on Iberian overseas expansion during the early modern period often asked themselves a crucial question: was there only one world or many? Were the Americas a 'New World,' unknown to the ancients, entirely detached from the rest of human history? Even after the invasion and occupation of the Americas, many European chroniclers continued to think that the world was divided into three parts - Europe, Asia, and Africa. In their descriptions of the Americas, they drew heavily on histories and travel reports pertaining to other epochs and locales, especially contemporary Asia and ancient Rome. At the same time, indigenous elites and mestizo authors in the Americas used 'Old World' history and news of distant conflicts to reflect on the immediacy of their historical experience. In this course, students will consider the ways in which diverse authors in New Spain (Mexico), Peru, and Brazil contemplated themselves in relation to remote times and places: from Greco-Roman Antiquity to Lutheran Germany, the Ottoman Mediterranean to the Apocalyptic End of Times. Students will analyze the many reflections, distortions, inversions, translations, uncanny resemblances, and strange parallel dimensions that resulted from these intellectual experiments. Primary sources include chronicles, poetry, theater, Afro-Catholic festivals, pictographic codices, feather mosaics, and maps. All texts offered in the original language and in English translation whenever possible. For graduate students and advanced undergraduates.",

In this bilingual course we will explore figurations of madness, mental illnesses, and other kinds of crises of the self in Latin American cultural objects, from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries. We will examine testimonies of religious experiences, novels, medical treatises, short stories, intimate diaries, and visual materials on disorderly states of mind and fragmented identities produced in territories that are today Cuba, Brazil, Mexico, Per&uacute;, Argentina, and the Dominican Republic, among others. In our examination of these objects and their historical contexts, we will discuss how colonial and state authorities have used psychiatric labels to control and regulate the lives of Afro-descendants and women in Latin American territories. We will also examine the ways in which men and women of color navigated through these labels in order to evade punishment, engage in creative processes, or simply live their lives.

        "description": "Nation states arise historically with the transfer of rule from the king to the people, which becomes depository of the general interest. But the old patrimonial state included different peoples, some of which continued to have their own constitutions, representative chambers, and codes of law. Unifying them was a pre-requisite for the emergence of the nation state. This was achieved through a process of nation building which, for most European states, culminated in the 19th century. Not so in Spain. The recurring crises of the Spanish state through the 19th and 20th centuries, and renewed territorial problems in the 21st, reveal an unachieved national project. The seminar will discuss theories of nationalism and sovereignty, and will consider the historical attempts of the Spanish state to manage its intractable nationalities problem, with particular reference to Catalonia. In addition to the state&iquest;s political fractures, the significance of culture for the insolubility of national identities in a single national project will be considered in some detail, as will the role of academic disciplines in furthering a cultural mandate in the sense of political power or in challenge to it.",

        "description": "This new graduate seminar examines the question of whether a new canon of theoretical monographs-as opposed to influential standalone essays or papers-has coalesced in recent years. We focus on a post-Foucaultian, post-1989 moment, understanding theory as an autonomous, interdisciplinary enterprise that is not subservient or reducible to philosophy or literary criticism but shares many of the core concerns of each discipline. The seminar provides students with a safe space to discuss cutting-edge ideas, arguing for, with, and against influential trends. We will study six to eight monographs in great detail, at least two of which will be determined by class vote. Of special interest are conceptual formations and methodologies that do not have an institutional home or pursue a narrow political agenda. Topics include anticolonial thinking, new materialism, affect studies, and the shadow of the linguistic turn. We may draw from a roster of thinkers such as Bruno Latour, Saidiya Hartman, Ver&oacute;nica Gago, Sianne Ngai, Rob Nixon, Sara Ahmed, Martin H&auml;gglund, Arturo Escobar, Mark Fisher, Wendy Brown, and Fred Moten. Previous experience with theory is recommended. Assignments sequence short papers with revisions, short student presentations, and a final paper. Stanford faculty and outside guests will be a mainstay. Broader community engagement with theory, as well as student integration of the subject matter towards their independent research projects, will be central goals. Open to co-terms, masters, and PhD students in the humanities and social sciences.",
