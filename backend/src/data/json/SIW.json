During this exclusive seminar, students will engage directly with a bipartisan mix of today's most skilled political practitioners about what they've learned from their wins and losses. Guest speakers will include current and former officials from presidential, gubernatorial, Senate and House campaigns who have held senior roles, such as campaign manager, chief strategist, general counsel, admaker, speechwriter, opposition researcher, communications director, digital director, pollster, and policy director. The head of a leading Super PAC and the executive director of a party committee will help explore the vital functions of outside groups. Students will play the roles of senior officials for a tabletop exercise and write an end-of-term case study analyzing a major strategic decision by a campaign.

        "description": "Navigating divided government: As Republicans take control of the House in 2023, the Biden administration faces a raft of investigations and the president will turn his focus more toward executive actions than legislative achievements. He also needs to figure out how to raise the debt ceiling and keep the government open, navigating brinkmanship that will spook the markets, while continuing to provide funding for the Ukrainian resistance to a Russian invasion despite growing GOP resistance to doing so. He'll have to manage this with the narrowest of majorities in the Senate and amid questions over whether he'll run again in 2024. But Biden is not the first president to deal with divided government. In fact, every modern president has dealt with this. In an exclusive seminar with Washington Post columnist and editorial writer James Hohmann, students will meet with key players in current and former administrations and Congresses who navigated these stormy crosscurrents. A special focus will be on how power is wielded in Washington and how cross-partisan coalitions get built. This course is only offered to students attending the Stanford in Washington Program in Washington, D.C.",

This seminar will explore the intertwining of several key challenges inherit in all transitions, while analyzing the effects of our current polarized politics and the Covid-19 pandemic on policy making.  Drawing upon an array of disciplines and approaches, our weekly meetings will include a series of discussions of readings from the social science literature; studies of health policy from medical ethicists and policy experts; articles from think tanks and government, and conversations with individuals from the worlds of policy, politics, and public health.  Collectively, we will seek to understand connections, systemic constraints and to formulate potential policy and political responses.  Students will engage in small group exercises on building a team in the Biden administration, along with developing health policy strategies that meet COVID-19 goals and ethical standards.  In addition, students will have the option to pursue a capstone project, based upon research conducted with the guidance of one of the instructors, another faculty member or policy maker.",

There's been an explosion of major legislation (both partisan and bipartisan), Executive Orders, Court Challenges, Congressional Oversight, and regulatory changes. Given all of this, how much has the policymaking process really changed? In this class, students will learn the advocacy and strategy tools needed to participate effectively in Washington legislative and regulatory policymaking; as well as related issues such as Money in Politics, and Ethics. We will examine both the nuts-and-bolts and the complex intricacies of policy development at the federal level, considering current and rapidly evolving topics as examples, while also drawing on historical precedents.

This course does not teach how things are supposed to work - instead we provide a window into how things do (and don't) work in Washington. The lessons are drawn from personal experiences from the instructors two decades working in Washington as a Congressional Science Fellow, Congressional staffer, and lobbyist. We will review and analyze some historic advocacy campaigns and dissect others as they make the front page of the The Washington Post during the quarter. We evolve the syllabus to accommodate your interests and dynamic happenings in DC. nOur sessions typically include a review of ongoing activities in the House and Senate and executive branch agencies (including topics well beyond the title of the course). We also invest time discussing how your internship and other coursework fits in the bigger DC ecosystem.",

Topics include the design, construction and contested signification of selected war memorials; the rights involved in the display and desecration of the American flag; censorship of sexually charged images; how the value of art is appraised; institutional critique and the art museum, among others.",
