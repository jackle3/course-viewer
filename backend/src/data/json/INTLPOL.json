        "description": "Recent advances in computing may place us at the threshold of a unique turning point in human history. Soon we are likely to entrust management of our environment, economy, security, infrastructure, food production, healthcare, and to a large degree even our personal activities, to artificially intelligent computer systems. The prospect of &quot;turning over the keys&quot; to increasingly autonomous systems raises many complex and troubling questions. How will society respond as versatile robots and machine-learning systems displace an ever-expanding spectrum of blue- and white-collar workers? Will the benefits of this technological revolution be broadly distributed or accrue to a lucky few? How can we ensure that these systems are free of algorithmic bias and respect human ethical principles? What role will they play in our system of justice and the practice of law? How will they be used or abused in democratic societies and autocratic regimes? Will they alter the geopolitical balance of power, and change the nature of warfare? The goal of CS22a is to equip students with the intellectual tools, ethical foundation, and psychological framework to successfully navigate the coming age of intelligent machines.",

Today, great power competition is back - or so it seems - with many describing our present era as a &quot;New Cold War&quot; between the United States and China and Russia. What happened? Is the Cold War label an illuminating or distorting analogy? What should the U.S. do to meet the challengers of great power competition in the 21st century? This course seeks to answer these questions about contemporary great power relations, first by tracing the historical origins of the U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relationships, next by assessing the similarities and differences between the Cold War and U.S.-Russia relations and U.S.-China relations today along three dimensions -- (1) Power, (2) Ideology, (3) Interdependence and Multilateralism - and third by discussing unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral policy prescriptions of US. policymakers.The main text for this course will be a new book in draft by Professor McFaul, as well accompanying academic articles.",

What are the key drivers of continuity or change, and how can we trace those drivers going forward, too?  What are the roles of contingency, chance, and choice, versus long-term underlying structure?  How can people, from whatever walk of life, identify and utilize levers of power to ty to shift the larger system?  What is a system, and how do systems behave?  To answer these questions and analyze how today's world came into being and where it might be headed, this course explores geopolitics and geoeconomics, institutions and technologies, citizenship and leadership.  We examine how our world works to understand the limits but also the possibilities of individual and collective agency, the phenomenon of perverse and unintended consequences, and ultimately, the nature of power.  Our goal is to investigate not just how to conceive of a smart policy, but how its implementation might unfold.  In sum, this course aims to combine strategic analysis and tactical agility.",

After a brief introduction to the region's history and geography, students will review the region's political systems and  -- using country-specific case studies -- look at how they are dealing with issues such as democracy versus authoritarianism, ethnic and religious divisions, economic development, climate change, and China's rising influence. The course will cover all these issues in the context of some of the real-world factors, as opposed to theoretical concepts that influence and shape policies and decisions in the region, and which in many ways pose a threat to Southeast Asia's remarkable potential.  It will also offer an opportunity for students to learn about the policymaking process and policy-related writing.",

The course aims to help students become savvier in their interactions with our economic and political systems and understand the governance issues that are critical to whether and how well institutions in the private and public sectors serve us. Topics include financial decisions, financial markets, banks and institutional investors; corporations and corporate governance; political economy and the rule of law as it applies to people and to organizations, and the role and functioning of the media. We will connect the material to specific issues such as climate change and justice, and discuss current events regularly throughout the course. Students will have the opportunity to explore a situation of their choosing in more depth through group final projects.

        "description": "Russia presents a puzzle for theories of socio-economic development and modernization and their relationship to state power in international politics. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought into being the new Russia (or Russian Federation) as its successor in international politics. Russia suffered one of the worst recessions and experienced 25 years of halting reform. Despite these issues, Russia is again a central player in international affairs. Course analyzes motivations behind contemporary Russian foreign policy by reviewing its domestic and economic underpinnings. Examination of concept of state power in international politics to assess Russia's capabilities to influence other states' policies, and under what conditions its leaders use these resources. Is contemporary Russia strong or weak? What are the resources and constraints its projection of power beyond its borders? What are the determinants of state power in international politics in the twenty-first century? This course is a combination of a lecture and discussion, and will include lectures, readings, class discussions, films and documentaries.",

The hypothesis to be explored in the course is that individuals, bureaucracies, and interest groups shape foreign policy decisions. That hypothesis will be tested against other more structural explanations of how countries behave in the international system. After a brief review of the academic literature in the first part of the course, the seminar will focus on several cases studies of foreign policy decision-making by the United States, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, as well as the United Nations and NATO.

        "description": "The course &quot;Israel: Society, Politics, and Policy&quot; invites students to explore modern Israel in comparative perspective. Few countries in the world have captured the American imagination as much as Israel and are at the same time as poorly understood. Whether for reasons of cultural difference, rapid domestic change, or competing political agendas, this intriguing and increasingly influential country is rarely subject to dispassionate, theoretically and empirically grounded analysis. The purpose of the course is to do just that: to examine Israel as a society, polity, constitutional system, and policy actor that is best understood in comparative analytical perspective. The course is broadly divided into four sections: (1) framing; (2) evolution; (3) society, politics, constitutionalism; and (4) policy and strategic culture. The course draws upon primary and secondary historical, political, economic, legal, and cultural sources to produce a rich interdisciplinary learning experience. Students should expect to gain a strong, up-to-date overview of modern Israel and to expand their understanding of the Middle East, US-Israeli ties, and the broader international system.",

        "description": "Strong monitoring and verification are at the heart of an effective arms control treaty. The better we can monitor, the better we can verify that treaty obligations are met and nobody is cheating. Arms control monitoring is stuck in the past, however, with tools and methods unchanged from the first nuclear negotiations in the 1970s. Meanwhile, other international regimes have gone ahead, with environmental and resource management treaties making big strides in the use of ubiquitous sensing and other new technologies. This course will explore how to bring these innovations to the arms control arena and create treaties for the 21st century. Students will have an opportunity in their course projects to create new ideas for monitoring and verification in a format useful to policymakers.

        "description": "(Formerly IPS 250) (Same as LAW 5009; formerly Law 656) This seminar examines the challenges of managing and resolving intractable political and violent intergroup and international conflicts. Employing an interdisciplinary approach drawing on social psychology, political science, game theory, and international law, the course identifies various tactical, psychological, and structural barriers that can impede the achievement of efficient solutions to conflicts. We will explore a conceptual framework for conflict management and resolution that draws not only on theoretical insights, but also builds on historical examples and practical experience in the realm of conflict resolution. This approach examines the need for the parties to conflicts to address the following questions in order to have prospects of creating peaceful relationships: (1) how can the parties to conflict develop a vision of a mutually bearable shared future; (2) how can parties develop trust in the enemy; (3) how can each side be persuaded, as part of a negotiated settlement, to accept losses that it will find very painful; and (4) how do we overcome the perceptions of injustice that each side are likely to have towards any compromise solution? We will consider both particular conflicts, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the South African transition to majority rule, as well as cross-cutting issues, such as the role international legal rules play in facilitating or impeding conflict resolution, the ways intragroup dynamics affect intergroup conflict resolution efforts, and the role of criminal accountability for atrocities following civil wars. Special Instructions: Section 01: Grades will be based on class participation, written assignments, and a final exam. Section 02: Up to five students, with consent of the instructor, will have the option to write an independent research paper for Research (R) credit in lieu of the written assignments and final exam for Section 01. After the term begins, students (max 5) accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.",

        "description": "Advances in machine learning, big data, networked communications, and computing are transforming our world and fueling calls for regulation. This course--a joint venture of a Stanford law professor and a former Member of the European Parliament and leading voice on tech regulation--offers a global perspective on the profound legal and governance challenges posed by the new digital technologies. Students will emerge with an understanding of how tech is reshaping the global distribution of political authority, rights, and resources, the existing state of law and regulation in the U.S., Europe, China, and elsewhere, and the new democratic governance models that are emerging in response. Each class session will feature one or more distinguished speakers from around the world drawn from the ranks of government officials, judges, activists, and academics who work in the fields of human rights, privacy, free speech, trade, and national security. There are no course prerequisites, whether in law or otherwise. Students will be responsible for one-page responses to each week's readings and a research paper to be turned in at the spring paper deadline. Students can take the course for 2 or 3 units, depending on research paper length. This class is cross-listed with LAW 4050, and undergraduates and graduates are eligible to take it. Stanford Non-Law students may enroll in INTLPOL 253 directly in Axess.

        "description": "The course will explore the safety, security and privacy implications of the automobile.  The modern automobile is a computer on wheels, with processors, sensors and networked connectivity managing hundreds of safety-critical functions. Automation will further drive the evolution of cars from the analog, mechanically-operated vehicles of the 20th century to the digital, AI-driven automobile of the 21st century. Overall, digitization has made cars safer, greener, and more enjoyable to ride in. But this digitization also introduces new risks. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities can expose vehicle occupants, commuters and pedestrians to safety and privacy risks. In addition to the physical, economic and psychological harms experienced by victims of cybersecurity attacks and intrusions, such attacks could undermine consumer and policy-maker confidence in the trustworthiness of digitally-dependent vehicles. The automotive industry and government regulators are in the formative stages of developing regulatory and governance frameworks for these risks, which may have broader implications for regulatory policy concerning digital technologies generally. Students will accompany the instructor on a deep dive into the regulatory, business, and geopolitical dimensions of the automobile. Each student will be expected to use the course to produce a publication-quality research paper on a relevant topic of their choosing (in consultation with the instructor), with mentorship from the instructor and peer support from fellow classmates. (Students may register for 2-4 units with increased research paper word count per unit. 10 slots, graduate students only, undergraduates by permission of instructor.)

Taught by a long-time cybersecurity practitioner, a recovering cyberlaw litigator, and a group of hearty, motivated TAs, each session will begin with a lecture covering the basics of an area of technology and how that technology has been misused in the past. Students will then complete a lab section, with the guidance of the instructor and assistants, where they attack a known insecure system using techniques and tools seen in the field. Each week, there will be a second lecture on the legal and policy impacts of the technologies and techniques we cover. By the end of the course, students are expected to have a basic understanding of some of the most common offensive techniques in use today as well as a comprehensive overview of the most important aspects of cyberpolicy and law. No computer science background is required. All students must have access to a Windows, Mac OS X or Linux laptop.",

        "description": "(Formerly IPS 281) With more than a billion people living on less than $2 a day, global poverty is one of the biggest challenges currently facing humanity. Even though those who suffer the most are located in the developing world, many of the policies, economic opportunities, and legal actions that offer the biggest potential for global poverty alleviation are made in the United States. This course will provide an introduction to the study of global poverty. What causes poverty? Why have some parts of the developing world done better at alleviating poverty than others? Can the world ever be free of poverty, as the World Bank's official motto suggests? How is the COVID pandemic affecting global poverty, and how should policymakers think about any potential tradeoffs? More generally, what can aspiring lawyers do to improve the condition of the world's impoverished? These are some of the questions this course is designed to address. This course is intended especially for future lawyers and policymakers who seek a deeper understanding of the developing world. After a brief overview that will familiarize students with the major concepts and empirical debates in poverty and development studies, we will examine a variety of 'causes' of poverty, from poor governance to lack of economic opportunity to the role of society. Since this course is just as much about what can be done, we shall also consider applied approaches to poverty alleviation. These types of interventions include political/legal reforms such as anti-corruption initiatives, 'rule of law' interventions, right to information programs, privatization, and community-driven development models; economic solutions such as cash transfers and microfinance; and technological approaches such as new methods for measuring policy impact and the application of new technologies for state identification and distribution programs. In addition to more typical scholarly readings, students will review poverty alleviation policy proposals and contracts made by various stakeholders (academics, NGOs, states, international bodies, etc.). Grading is based on participation, a presentation of research or a proposal, and, in consultation with the professor, a research paper. The research paper may be a group project (Section 01) graded MP/R/F or an individual in-depth research proposal either of which could be the basis for future field research (Section 02) graded H/P/R/F. Students approved for Section 01 or Section 02 may receive R credit.  Automatic grading penalty waived for research paper.  Cross-listed with LAW 5025.  This course is taught in conjunction with the India Field Study component (Law 5026). Students may enroll for this course alone or for both this course and Law 5026 with consent of the instructor (12 students will come to India).

        "description": "As two of the most-consequential global powers, China and the United States have great influence on many complex transnational challenges, including climate change, threats to food and water security, nuclear proliferation, health security, and cyberspace. Further, none of these challenges can be managed by China or the United States alone and none can be managed successfully without at least some level of US-China coordination. This unique course will be taught jointly by faculty from Stanford and Peking University and is open to students from both schools. The course will examine American and Chinese perceptions of and approaches to resolving a number of different transnational challenges with the goal of identifying obstacles to and opportunities for cooperation. Enrollment is limited to 20 students, apply at https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/4d59f97817bd4450b7feb57018dcf35b by March 24, 2023.  Those accepted will be notified by the week of March 27, 2023.",

        "description": "This class will examine the complex inter-relationship between the three great states of Northeast Asia - Japan, Korea and China. This class will take a historical approach but will focus as well on contemporary relations and policy issues. Topics to be covered will include Japanese imperialism and colonialism, the road to the war in the Pacific, the consequences of Japan's defeat, the Communist victory in China, the Korean War and the creation of the postwar architecture. We will focus heavily on the dynamics of the Sino-Japanese relationship, the shift from containment, to engagement, and then to rivalry. The class will look at the two Koreas and their relationship to Japan and China, and to the great powers. We will explore the tension between integration and nationalism, and the future of the triangular relationship. Class will combine lectures and class discussion, with short essays or papers and will be offered for both 3 and 4 credits.",

How do you create a sampling strategy, select a study design, and ensure ethical conduct with human subjects? This course takes students through the process of health research in under-resourced countries from the development of the initial research question and literature review to securing support and detailed planning for field work. Students progressively develop and receive weekly feedback on a concept note to support a funding proposal addressing a research question of their choosing.

Yet the development and workings of weapons technologies are commonly treated as the esoteric domain of scientists and engineers, rather than policymakers and policy analysts. Poor outcomes result when those who study, oversee, promote, or oppose the use of armaments fail to understand their origins, effects, and social meanings. This course explores weapons technologies as both material and social artifacts: how and why they are developed, the manner in which their proper uses and implications are contested, and the means by which they are proliferated or eliminated. Emphasis is placed on technologies central to modern global security, from the nuclear warhead to the machine gun, and on analytic tools for assessing their implications.",

In addition, the course includes an assessment of key global financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, and the global effort to reform the international financial architecture. The goal of the course is to equip students with the tools to analyze international macroeconomic issues, events, and policies. Students will analyze economic data of countries with a view to assessing the economic health and vulnerabilities of countries. They will propose policies to address the identified economic vulnerabilities, and will assess the feasibility of policy implementation. In addition, the &quot;In the News&quot; segment in class will discuss and analyze current events in areas relevant to the course. (This course was formerly IPS 202.)

How do bureaucratic politics and interagency processes across different country contexts facilitate and constrain leaders' decisions? How do factors like relative military strength, regime type, alliances, internal unrest, and regional dynamics impact these decisions? How do small states develop and implement foreign policy compared to major powers? This course draws on scholarship from the political sciences, psychology, history, sociology, and economics to analyze how choices made by individuals, small groups, or coalitions representing nation-states result in policies or strategies with international outcomes. Students will learn how to leverage various social science theories and methodologies to explore and assess how leaders across the world weigh different policy options when responding to international problems.

It will focus on the way that cyber issues impact people and organizations across sectors - from government and law to business, tech, and others - and how people and organizations can and should approach the myriad cyber challenges. This is not a technical or computer science course and no technical background nor prerequisites are necessary. In the first part of the course, we will introduce cyber policy and security fundamentals. The second part of the course will explore cyber policy and security aspects related to economics, psychology, law, warfare, international relations, critical infrastructure, privacy, and innovation. The third part of the course will be focused mostly on a number of case studies designed to simulate the challenges faced by policy-makers and executive-level decision makers. This course is heavily discussion-based and so attendance is required. Assignments will consist of three short papers and a take-home final exam. All graduate students are welcome to enroll, especially those in the international policy, law, and business programs. Undergraduate enrollment only by permission of instructor.",

We will then examine the incorporation and operation of international law in the U.S. legal system. In the second half of the course, we will look at a series of contemporary international law topics and issues, including international dispute resolution, international human rights law, the law governing coercion and the use of armed force, the law of armed conflict, international environmental law, and international criminal law. Throughout, we will consider current issues and problems arising in the international arena, as well as whether and to what extent international law affects the behavior of states.

The seminar introduces the key theories relevant to state-building generally, and strengthening the rule of law in particular. This course explores the multidisciplinary nature of development --- through readings, lectures, guest lectures, case studies, and seminar discussions --- and asks how lawyers fit in and contribute to the process? The set of developing countries considered within the scope of this workshop is broad. It includes, among others, states engaged in post-conflict reconstruction, e.g., Cambodia, Timor Leste, Rwanda, Iraq, Sierra Leone; states still in conflict, e.g., Afghanistan, Somalia; the poorest states of the world that may not fall neatly into the categories of conflict or post-conflict, e.g., Nepal, Haiti; least developed states that are not marked by high levels of violent conflict at all, e.g., Bhutan; and more developed states at critical stages of transition, e.g., Tunisia, Georgia, Hungary. Grading is based on participation, a presentation of research or a proposal, and, in consultation with the professor, a research paper. The research paper may be a group project or an individual in-depth research proposal, either of which could be the basis for future field research. CONSENT APPLICATION: The seminar is open by consent to up to sixteen (16) JD, SPILS, and LLM students, and graduate students from other departments within Stanford University. This course is taught in conjunction with the India Field Study component (Law 5026). Students may enroll for this course alone or for both this course and Law 5026 with consent of the instructor (12 students will come to India). To apply for this course, students must complete and submit a Consent Application Form available on the SLS website (Click Courses at the bottom of the homepage and then click Consent of Instructor Forms).

Given that many of the most significant and complex national and international challenges today center on fundamental questions of human rights, understanding the legal regime that governs these rights is an important part of a comprehensive legal education.  This course serves as an introduction to the law, theory and practice of international human rights, together with the instruments, organizations and arrangements that affect their implementation and enforcement.  It will explore human rights as a philosophical and legal concept, and briefly probe differences between human rights, civil rights, and development frames. The course will then focus on the legal regime through which sovereign states have established human rights instruments and doctrine as part of positive international law, sometimes with binding domestic legal effects. We will review the foundations and history of international human rights law; the major international and regional human rights instruments and institutions; mechanisms and strategies of enforcement; and selected current issues in the field.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Class Participation, Exam.  Advanced undergraduate and graduate students may request enrollment by sending a statement of interest to Professor Achiume (achiume@law.stanford.edu).  Requests will be reviewed on a rolling basis.  Undergraduates who wish to enroll in this course must have completed HUMRTS 101 as a prerequisite.",

        "description": "(LAW 7086) The political, social, and legal problems confronting societies after periods of mass human rights violations or war have attracted increasing attention from policymakers and scholars in the last three decades. This course will examine the legacies of atrocities and the institutions and processes that governments and citizens most often use to address them, comparing approaches from across the globe. South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission; the prosecution of Chile's former dictator, Augusto Pinochet; Argentina's reparations to victims of its military regime; and the International Criminal Court are among the best-known policy responses to those problems. In addition, non-legal interventions---such as the Berlin Holocaust Memorial and Nelson Mandela's many symbolic gestures toward reconciliation with white South Africans---may have important social and political effects. In addition to initiatives at the national and international levels, we will devote some attention to transitional justice at the local level. A recurring theme throughout the course will be the connections between atrocities and transitional justice measures intended to address them, on the one hand, and economic justice and development, on the other.

        "description": "(LAW 1047) Large corporations now routinely spend millions of dollars to protect human rights and the environment. Shell Nigeria builds hospitals and schools in the Niger Delta. Nike employs hundreds of inspectors to improve conditions for the factory workers who produce its shoes across Asia and Latin America. Technology companies such as Facebook have scrambled to fend off the threat of new regulation since the Cambridge Analytica revelations. Other examples abound, across industries and around the globe. &quot;Don't be evil&quot; (Google's former motto) may be one motivation for these companies, but something more mundane is also at work: many companies believe they will do well, financially, if they do good, ethically. This course examines questions that lawyers in large law firms, corporations, NGOs, and government agencies regularly confront: --What does it mean for a company to &quot;do good&quot;? Should it care? --When does it serve a company's interest to take costly action to address human rights, labor, and environmental concerns? --What tactics have activists used to shift public opinion, media frames, and the law, and thereby change companies' incentives? We will learn through seminar-style discussion, lectures, role play, and small group exercises. Several guest speakers with experience in business, advocacy, or in between will provide insights from their experiences on the ground.

        "title": "Data: Privacy, Property and Security",
        "description": "The collection, use and marketing of personal data are ubiquitous in the digital age. This seminar will explore the diverse legal regimes regulating personal data--including privacy, property and security--and the imperfect nature of their protections. Legal rules are rapidly evolving to address, if not resolve, the inevitable conflicts between privacy, property and security in relation to personal data. Laws have been enacted and new ones are under consideration at the national, state and even municipal levels, as well as around the world. Norms are emerging to guide these conflicts in the operation of business. Technology is evolving that can facilitate the protection, or accelerate the exploitation, of personal data. At the heart of all these developments is the question, who owns and controls personal data in the digital age. The same piece of data may in different hands raise different expectations. As an example, A may have a privacy expectation that her purchase from an online marketplace is no one's business but her own. B, the app that served as intermediary between the buyer and seller, may have a property or contract expectation that it owns the metadata and other information about A's buying habits. C, a government agency, may have a security interest in collecting or unearthing the details of A's purchase of particular items. This same triad of interests is implicated across a wide variety of highly sensitive personal data, such as location information, facial recognition and medical results. This seminar will explore these data rules, norms, technologies and conflicts through three sessions of lecture and interactive exercises addressed to privacy, property and security, respectively; four sessions devoted to presentations from leading representatives of consumer, corporate and government interests, with questioning by students in the class; and two sessions devoted to discussion of student answers to problem sets, focusing on an exploration of the privacy-property-security conflict and on forward-looking solutions to the protection of personal data.

        "description": "This course will examine contemporary challenges and trade-offs for tech law and policy decision-making presented by false information online. Topics will include content policy and regulatory responses to election misinformation; medical misinformation; the spread of misinformation in armed conflict and situations of widespread human rights violations; and conspiracy theories and rumors in the areas of science, climate, religion, and politics. Along with the faculty, guest speakers from academia and industry thought leaders will present on these topics, followed by a discussion. In addition, students will analyze real-world dilemmas confronting policymakers through practical case studies and will assume the role of a policymaker from either the private sector, the government, or a non-governmental organization as part of each class. Finally, this course will explore regulatory, policy, technological, and other solutions to enhance the integrity of the online information ecosystem and address the growing problem of false information online. Special Instructions: Up to five Law students, with the consent of the instructors, will have the option to write an independent research paper for Law School Research (R) credit. For students in this section (02), the research paper will replace the Final Policy Memo. All other elements used in grading will apply.
