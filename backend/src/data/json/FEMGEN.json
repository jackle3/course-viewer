It emerged early as a place where queer people could congregate and interact more freely, but it also was frequently at the vanguard when it came to organizing around issues of gender and sexuality. At the same time, as some queer communities of the Bay Area have done extremely well, others have continued to have to struggle for their rights, their place and their say. This course explores the genesis and legacy of different queer communities and explores their impact on Bay Area culture. Topics discussed will include the Beats, lesbian separatism, the response to AIDS, the relationship between different LGBTQ communities and the police, trans activism, prostitution and sex worker rights. The course combines literature, art and poetry of seven decades with historical documents, as well as local visits and walking tours. The last third of the course allows students to pursue archival or oral history research projects, as students unearth their own stories of queer San Francisco.",

        "description": "Emerging from the demographic, political, and cultural shifts of the late twentieth century, LatinX Literature flourishes in the twenty-first century as a hemispherically American corpus of texts. Like both ChicanX and Puerto Rican literatures before it, LatinX Literature emerges from various movements for social justice to challenge both the Anglo and the Hispanic established literary traditions of the Americas. As a transnational, pluralistic, heterogeneous, and dynamic category that considers the writings of diverse peoples with cultural ties to Latin America residing in the U.S., it complicates and transgresses the linguistic, geopolitical and cultural borders of the Americas, including those of the Afro-Caribbean, Luso-Brazilian, and the Native First Nations. Aligning itself with the issues, styles, and topics of the Global South, LatinX Literature is a product of the kind of 'border thinking' that critic Walter Mignolo has described as a 'pluriversal epistemology that interconnects the plurality and diversity of decolonial projects.' Acknowledging its emergence from literal and theoretical border spaces and decolonizing epistemologies, the 'X' of LatinX intentionally inflects the link to an origin in LGBTQI discourses signifying 'a more inclusive, non-gender-binary designation for LatinX peoples' and as a border literature that articulates heterogeneous ways of making meaning.

Philosophical work in social epistemology recognizes that knowledge is usually dependent on a range of social institutions, practices, and relations, and considers how these social dimensions of knowledge should be theorized. Feminist social epistemology goes further, arguing that the oppression that characterizes social relations also shapes epistemic practices, norms, and institutions. A distinctive feature of feminist social epistemology is its combination of descriptive and normative elements. Feminist accounts typically begin by identifying features of actual epistemic systems that affect who counts as a knower and what counts as knowledge. This descriptive account is then used to guide the development of norms and recommendations for action. In this class we will begin with a brief history of feminist epistemology before critically examining contemporary work on testimony and ignorance.",

        "description": "This is a creative writing course for writers of all genders who are interested in thinking about patriarchy and how to resist it. Our course will aim to complicate the idea that men benefit from patriarchy and are its primary enforcers, while the rest of us are simply suffering under it. We'll ask ourselves how patriarchy is bad for ALL of us, and how ALL of us are implicated in its perpetuation. Do we ALL have the reasons and the resources to leave patriarchy--and can we start to leave it right now? We'll read works of scholarship and literature that investigate patriarchy as a human relational problem. We'll write fiction and nonfiction in which we explore the ways patriarchy has shaped us, challenge ourselves to resist its manifestations in our relationships, envision a future without patriarchy, and begin to live that future right now. Most crucially, we will practice creating a space in which all of us can speak without fear of judgment about our experiences of a fraught topic.",

        "title": "Queer Stories (ENGLISH 25Q)",
        "description": "Queer Stories is a creative writing class open to any and all students, regardless of how they define their gender or sexuality. The goals of the class are to read widely in the canon of twentieth and twenty-first century queer prose literature, and to write critical and creative work that engages with the styles, modes, and subjects of these writers. As we read and discuss texts, students will consider a variety of questions: How has queer romance, relationships, and sexuality been represented over the years, in both coded and explicit ways? How have writers grappled with representing our evolving sense of gender as a continuum rather than a binary? How have queer writers interrogated or understood the concept of family? How do queer writers handle the question of the &quot;universal&quot; reader to whom, arguably, they might be speaking? (In a 2012 interview with Lambda Literary, book critic Daniel Mendelsohn argues,contentiously, &quot;It is precisely the gay book's ability to be interesting to a straight reader that makes it a great book.&quot;)  Lastly, students will also create writing of their own that in some way draws upon the aesthetics or sensibilities of the authors we have read. These pieces may be short stories, personal essays, or texts that--in the spirit of queerness--blur or interrogate standard demarcations of genre. The content of this work might grapple with questions of gender and sexuality, but it might instead be queer in its affect, outlook, or style. In both the reading and writing they do in this class, students will engage with work that deviates from literary convention in the lives it represents and the ways in which it represents them.",

What is the relationship between historically constructed ideas of femininity and masculinity and madness? Why have women been the witches and hysterics of the past, while men experienced neurasthenia and schizoid conditions? Why have there historically been more women than men among the mentally ill? How has the emotional and psychological suffering of women differed from that of men, and how has it changed over time? Among the sources we use to explore these questions are memoirs and films such as The Three Faces of Eve and One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. By contrasting the changing ways women and men experienced mental illness and were treated in the past, this seminar will elucidate the historically embedded nature of medical ideas, diagnoses and treatments.",

You will learn how to pay close attention to the often radically new ways these writers bent language to their purposes to express complex emotions and vexed political realities; in your own essay writing, you will learn how to write clearly and persuasively about small units of text and to craft longer critical analyses attentive to language, history, and culture.

This conflict and the stakes for reproductive rights has never been more fraught than now, with the loss of the Constitutional protection of abortion rights when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in the Dobbs decosion in June, 2022.This course explores the long history of women's reproductive lives in the US as the context for that struggle. Topics include the history of sexuality, birth control, abortion, childbirth, and motherhood. We will examine personal experience of these processes, and the religious, moral, legal, and policy frameworks that sought to regulate them. We also explore the series of feminist movements that emerged to protect reproductive rights, and the current political polarization. We will conclude by examining current court cases since Dobbs, both those that would protect reproductive rights and those that seek to further restrict them.",

Students will read a wide variety of stories and essays in order to develop a language for working through the themes, forms, and concerns of the queer prose canon. Students will complete and workshop a piece of writing that in some way draws upon the aesthetics or sensibilities of the work we have read, culled from exercises completed throughout the quarter. This final piece may be a short story, a personal essay, a chapter from a novel or memoir, or a piece that, in the spirit of queerness, blurs or interrogates standard demarcations of genre. The course is open to any and all students, regardless of how they define their gender or sexuality. NOTE: First priority to undergrads.

Writers are some of our most serious and eloquent investigators of these questions, and in this class we'll read many of our greatest writers on the subject of femininity, as embodied by both men and women, children and adults, protagonists and antagonists. From Virginia Woolf to Ernest Hemingway, from Beloved to Gone Girl (and even &quot;RuPaul's Drag Race&quot;), we'll ask how the feminine is rendered and contested. We'll do so in order to develop a history and a vocabulary of femininity so that we may, in this important time, write our own way in to the conversation. This is first and foremost a creative writing class, and our goals will be to consider in our own work the importance of the feminine across the entire spectrum of gender, sex, and identity. We will also study how we write about femininity, using other writers as models and inspiration. As we engage with these other writers, we will think broadly and bravely, and explore the expressive opportunities inherent in writing. We will explore our own creative practices through readings, prompted exercises, improv, games, collaboration, workshop, and revision, all with an eye toward writing the feminine future.",

How did leading thinkers of the region conceptualize the nature of colonialism and the methods of nationalist resistance? Did nationalism represent all social classes in British India? Did it also alienate and exclude? What tactics of resistance were developed in anti-colonial movements, especially by M. K. Gandhi? Why did independence arrive with the partition of British India into two nation-states - India and Pakistan? How did the colonial legacy shape the post-colonial nation-states of South Asia? In this this introductory lecture-based survey course on the history of modern South Asia, we will explore the answers to these questions.

        "description": "Provides an overview of cinema from around the world since 1960, highlighting the cultural, political, and economic forces that have shaped various film movements over the last six decades. Specific topics may vary by term/year/instructor. This term's topic, Queer Cinemas around the World, engages with a range of queer cinematic forms and queer spectatorial practices in different parts of the world, as well as BIPOC media from North America. Through film and video from Kenya, Malaysia, India, The Dominican Republic, China, Brazil, Palestine, Japan, Morocco, the US etc., we will examine varied narratives about trans experience, same-sex desire, LGBTQI2S+ rights, censorship, precarity, and hopefulness. This course will attune us to regional cultural specificities in queer expression and representation, prompting us to move away from hegemonic and homogenizing understandings of queer life and media. Notes: Screenings will be held on Wednesdays at 5:30PM in Oshman Hall. Screening times will vary slightly from week to week.",

        "description": "India is the world's largest producer of films in over 20 languages, and Bollywood is often its most visible avatar, especially on US university curricula. This course will introduce you to a range of media from the Indian subcontinent across commercial and experimental films, documentaries, streaming media, and online cultures. We will engage in particular with questions of sexuality, gender, caste, religion, and ethnicity in this postcolonial context and across its diasporas, including in the Caribbean. Given this course's emphasis on close cinematic analysis, we will analyze formal aspects of cinematography, editing, mise-en-sc&egrave;ne, and performance, and how these generate spectatorial pleasure, star and fan cultures, and particular modes of representation. This course fulfills the WIM requirement for Film and Media Studies majors. Note: Screenings will be held on Thursdays at 5:30 PM. Screening times will vary from week to week and may range from 90 to 180 minutes.",

These images and texts also present what it means to be in relationship with one another, and what it means to reject established gender roles. In this course, students will examine and research how lessons learned from popular culture impact the treatment and expectations of people individually as well as in relationship with each other. Specifically, we will analyze the ways in which news articles, movie clips, magazine advertisements, television commercials as well as other texts present gender identities as binary as well as gender roles of those binary structures. How are the roles and bodies of all genders presented as objects open to scrutiny, critique, exploitation, abuse, and awe? After examining rhetorical strategies and devices, we&iquest;ll read excerpts from texts by social critics such as Susan Bordo who analyze culture and it&iquest;s presentation of bodies. Through case studies of films and campaign ads, visits to spaces on campus that construct gender binaries, and field trips to off campus sites, we will explore how representations of gender challenge or reinforce messages in popular media.",

How are male identifying individuals expected to behave in communities shaped by masculinity? What spaces are there for gender non-conforming folks in communities shaped by masculinity?

Relying on feminist critiques of power, students will examine how constructions of gender and sexuality impact our daily lives as well as how we relate to others in those relationships while negotiating power. Activities, readings, and discussions will prompt students to reflect on ways society constructs sex, gender, and intimacy via media and politics. We will explore the following themes through an intersectional lens: codes of masculinity, concepts and practicalities of affirmative consent in straight and LGBTQIA contexts, sexual harassment and sexual empowerment, and the lived experience of dating, romance, and relationships.",

        "description": "In 1972, Title IX legislation opened up a vast range of opportunities for women in sports. Since then, women's sports have continued to grow yet the fight for recognition and equality persists. Simply put, men's sports are more popular than women's--so much so, in fact, that people often make the hierarchical distinction between &quot;sports&quot; and &quot;women's sports.&quot; But what would it take to get more women's sports featured on ESPN or more female athletes on the cover of Sports Illustrated? And, given the well-documented corruption at the highest levels of men's sports, should such an ascent in popularity be the goal for women's sports? This course will map out and respond to the multifaceted issues that emerge when women enter the sports world. Throughout the quarter, we will explore the fight for gender equality in sports through historical, cultural, and rhetorical lenses. NOTE: Class will meet in Old Union, Room 302",

We will look at movements for women's self-determination in the 19th and 20th centuries, and women's emergence as national political leaders in the 20th century.  We then focus on a series of global women leaders, primarily heads of state, and explore their biographies and historical contributions.  What conditions have permitted women to emerge as heads of state in the 20th century? Have women made a distinctive contribution as heads of state and political activists?

Some may repeat what South Korea has said about itself: that it is racially homogenous, an ethnic community that can trace their ancestry back 5000 years. Some may wonder how a country that is often perceived as Christian and conservative developed pop culture like K-pop, or queer subcultures, or feminist activism. This class will use South Korea as a case study to think historically and geographically about race and gender through the following topics: when did racial discourses begin to emerge in Korea? What have been South Korea's significant encounters with the figure of the Other in its modern history? How were women implicated in the changing landscape of colonial Korea, the Korean War, Korea's Vietnam War experience, and compressed modernization? How have the influx of migrant labor and North Korean refugees impacted ideas about race in South Korea? And finally, what does K-pop tell us about shifting South Korean views of race and gender? The primary materials that we will analyze will be drawn from Korean fiction, film, and media in translation.",

Our course will trace how Hollywood has depicted&quot;passing&quot; from the early 20th century to the present. Just a few of our films will include Gentleman's Agreement (1947), Imitation of Life (1959), School Ties (1992), White Chicks (2004), and Blackkklansman (2018). Through these films, we will explore the overlaps and differences between antisemitism, racism, misogyny, and queerphobia, both onscreen and in real life. In turn, we will also study the ideological role of passing films: how they thrill audiences by challenging social boundaries and hierarchies, only to reestablish familiar boundaries by the end. With this contradiction, passing films often help audiences to feel enlightened without actually challenging the oppressive status quo. Thus, we will not treat films as accurate depictions of real-world passing, but rather as cultural tools that help audiences to manage ideological contradictions about race, gender, sexuality, and class. Students will finish the course by creating their own short films about passing.",

We will hear firsthand from activists about the writers and thinkers that shaped their work, the relationship between reading and changemaking, and the importance of amplifying new, more expansive definitions of reproductive justice. We?ll consider how a craft-based approach allows us to avoid the didactic and lean into the complexity, nuance, and intimacy that the best political writing has to offer. Students will be supported in conceptualizing, executing, and revising an individual creative writing project - fiction, personal narrative, or hybrid form - that represents a thoughtful contribution to the question: What does reproductive justice mean to you? In the first half of the course, we?ll be engaged mostly with the stories of others - using the reproductive justice theoretical framework to contextualize fiction, memoir, and political narrative. During this time, students will begin formulating an idea for their final creative project, and the final four weeks of the class will focus on drafting and revision. Our inquiries will focus on questions of craft and the power of narrative technique to lead us to more complex, personal, and inclusive understandings of reproductive justice.",

At the same time, science and technology are often lauded as objective systems capable of producing color- and gender-blind truths and social good for all of us. This course pushes beyond the headlines and the hashtags to think about the complex relationship between gender, race and science. Together we will research chronically understudied voices and contributions in the history of science and technology and have the opportunity to read and participate in some of the efforts to highlight their stories through a Wikipedia edit-a-thon and final research project. We will also rigorously think through why the historical and current under-representation of women and people of color matters for the questions that are asked, methodologies that are used, and science and technology that is eventually produced. This course fulfills the advanced PWR requirement for the Notation in Science Communication (NSC).  Prerequisite: first two levels of the writing requirement or equivalent transfer credit.

After briefly surveying the social determinants of sexual assault, this course will dive deeply into exploring the costs of sexual assault including the costs of reporting and engaging in the legal system, the costs to an individual's educational trajectory, the costs to an individual's ability to seek and maintain employment, the costs to making ends meet financially, and the macro-level costs for society. After surveying the literature, students will have the opportunity to apply their knowledge by learning about conducting research on sexual assault as an undergraduate student, designing their own research proposal, or volunteering with an organization that engages in work on sexual assault.",

        "description": "It has often been said that the post-9/11 era has been one of never-ending war for the United States.  Privatization and the increasing proliferation of ever more removed technologies of killing have raised questions regarding the disposability of racialized populations targeted for submission or containment.  The global, ubiquitous nature of the U.S. military industrial complex has made war synonymous with impunity.nnHowever, racialized populations have arguably been under siege and positioned as disposable since the colonization of the Americas.  This course draws upon Alexander Weheliye&iquest;s (2014) challenge to move beyond the particular, querying how racialized, gendered experiences condition more expansive notions of the human.  Following Jodi Kim&iquest;s notion of the protracted afterlife of the Cold War as epistemological structure, this course traces the continuities and transformations in constructions of populations as more or less human, from settler colonial conquest to the post-9/11 era.  How has racial and gendered violence functioned to determine not only which bodies matter but which lives are legible and which subjects granted the full range of human complexity?  Recognizing the &iquest;layered interconnectedness of political violence, racialization, and the human,&iquest; this course also engages &iquest;the existence of alternative modes of life alongside the violence, subjection, exploitation, and racialization that define the modern human&iquest; (Weheliye, 1-2).",

Historically entangled with ideals of heroism, nobility, and civility, the pen and the sword have been the privileged instruments of men. Yet, throughout history, women have picked up the pen and the sword in defense, despair, and outrage as well as with passion, vision, and inspiration. This course is dedicated to them, and to study of works on love, sex, and power that articulate female experience. In our readings and seminars, we will encounter real and fictive women in their own words and in narrations and depictions by others from classical antiquity to the present, with a special focus on the Renaissance and on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Touching on such topics as flattery and slander through the study of misogynistic, protofeminist, and feminist works in the early modern and modern periods in various European literary traditions, we will consider questions of truth and falsehood in fiction and in life. Course materials span a variety genres and media, from poetry, letters, dialogues, public lectures, treatises, short stories, and drama to painting, sculpture, music, and film works regarded for their aesthetic, intellectual, religious, social, and political value and impact.",

        "description": "CW: SA/GBV: Access the Application Consent Form Here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Ahwwcl-vQoxVod0PL9HHQg752DJlh3M/edit?usp=sharing ouid=103752650760265096645&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true.  Over the past decade the issue of campus sexual assault and harassment has exploded into the public discourse. Multiple studies have reinforced the finding that between 20-25% of college women (and a similar proportion of students identifying as transgender and gender-nonconforming, as well as approximately 10% of male students) experience sexual assault carried out through force or while the victim was incapacitated during their time in college. Fraternities have been found to be associated with an increased risk of female sexual assault on campus. Vulnerable students and those from marginalized groups are often found to be at increased risk. This is also a significant problem in k12 education. Sexual harassment rates are even higher. Intimate partner violence, stalking, and online harassment are also significant problems on campuses. Survivors have come forward across the country with harrowing stories of abuse followed by what they describe as an insensitive or indifferent response from college administrators. These survivors have launched one of the most successful, and surprising, social movements in recent memory. As a result, the federal government under President Obama stepped up its civil rights enforcement in this area, with over 300 colleges and universities under investigation for allegedly mishandling student sexual assault complaints as of the end of that administration. At the same time, the Obama administration's heightened response led to a series of high-profile lawsuits by accused students who assert that they were falsely accused or subjected to mishandled investigations that lacked sufficient due process protections. The one thing that survivors and accused students appear to agree on is that colleges are not handling these matters appropriately and appeared to be more concerned with protection the institutional brand than with stopping rape or protecting student rights. Colleges have meanwhile complained of being whipsawed between survivors, accused students, interest groups, and enforcement authorities. In an about-face that many found shocking, the Trump Administration rescinded all of the Obama-era guidance on the subject of sexual harassment and has promulgated new proposed regulations that would offer significantly greater protection to accused students and to institutions and commensurately less protection to survivors. An increasingly partisan Congress has been unable to pass legislation addressing the issue. The Biden Administration recently put forward significantly re-worked proposed regulations to undo what survivors saw as the harm of the Trump-era regulations. This course focuses on the legal, policy, and political issues surrounding sexual assault and harassment on college campuses. Each week we will read, dissect, compare and critique a set of readings that include social science, history, literature, legal, policy, journalism, and narrative explorations of the topic of campus sexual assault. We will explore the history of gender-based violence and the efforts to implement legal protections for survivors in the educational context. We will also study the basic legal frameworks governing campus assault, focusing on the relevant federal laws such as Title IX and the Clery Act. We will critically explore the ways that responses to this violence have varied by the race, class, gender identity, sexual orientation, and other characteristics of parties and institutions. We will hear from guest speakers who are actively involved in shaping policy and advocating in this area, including lawyers, survivors, activists, medical professionals, and policymakers. The subject matter of this course is sensitive, and students are expected to treat the material with maturity. Much of the reading and subject matter may be upsetting and/or triggering for students who identify as survivors. There is no therapeutic component for this course, although supportive campus resources are available for those who need them. Elements used in grading: Grades will be based on class attendance, class participation, and either several short reflection papers and a class presentation (Law section 01) or an independent research paper and class presentation, or a project and class presentation (undergraduates, graduates, and Law section 02). After the term begins, law students accepted into the course can transfer from section 01 into section 02, which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. This class has both in-person and remote components. Enrollment is by INSTRUCTOR PERMISSION.

Students will cultivate their skills as artist-scholars through written assignments and the creation of performances in response to the assigned material. Attendance and written reflection about a live performance event on campus are required. Students will also learn various meditation practices as tools for making and critiquing performance, in both our seminar discussions and performance workshops. We will approach mindfulness as method and theory in our own practice, as well as in relation to the works studied. We will also consider the ethics and current debates concerning the mindfulness industry. Examples of artists studied include James Luna, Nao Bustamante, Renee Cox, William Pope.L, Cassils, boychild, Curious, Adrian Piper, Xandra Ibarra, Val&eacute;rie Reding, Guillermo Gomez-Pe&ntilde;a, and Ana Mendieta.",

Works may include offerings from Eve Sedgwick, Jos&eacute; Esteban Mu&ntilde;oz, Audre Lorde and new books of poems by Franny Choi, Charif Shanihan, Paul Tran as well as others.

        "description": "Outlaw sensibilities, self-made kinships, chosen lineages, utopic futurity, exilic commitment, and rage at institutions that police the borders of the normal these are among the attitudes that make up queer in its contemporary usage. -David J. Getsy. This hands-on studio based course explores queer as a form of art production. Artists and thinkers use queer to signal defiance to the mainstream and an embrace of difference, uniqueness and self-determination. To be intolerable is to demand that the normal, the natural and the common be challenged. To do this is not to demand inclusion, but rather to refuse to accept any operations of exclusion and erasure that make up the normal and posit compulsory sameness. Queer Sculpture is also about the strategic effort to appropriate and subvert conventional art practices and tactics that may involve everything from shifts in the content of a work and its targeted audience to the methods by which it is produced and its formal properties. The political imperatives of a queer or queered position will shape thematic investigations of practices related to utopic futurity, anti-assimilationist practices, failure, abstraction, the archive, camp, drag and alternative families. Classes will require reading, discussing, and making. Students will produce artwork for critiques and participate in discussions of the readings. The course includes guest artists and fieldtrips to local LGBTQ archives.",

The influence of gender (sociocultural) &quot;norms&quot;, i.e. gendered behaviors and relations, on human biology is juxtaposed with the role of biological traits on the construction of gender identity, roles and relationships, thereby focusing on the interactions of sex and gender on health and medical outcomes. Problems that may arise by labeling conditions that vary in incidence, prevalence and/or severity across the &quot;male-female&quot; spectrum as &quot;men's&quot; or &quot;women's&quot; health issues will be discussed. In addition, the importance of recognizing the spectrum of sex and gender, as well as sexual orientation, in clinical practice from pediatric to geriatric populations, will be highlighted, with consideration of varying perspectives within different race/ethnic, religious, political, and other groups.",

        "description": "This course explores life-writing as a form of feminist praxis. Feminist life-writing is an art form grounded in truth-telling, activism, and self-making that emerges from the long tradition of women writing private lives. Beginning with the politicized practices of second wave feminists up through contemporary trends in memoir and autofiction, we will confront an array of intersectional autobiographies that connect personal experience to broader movements, power structures, and oppressions. How has life-writing contributed to the articulation of feminist consciousness? How has feminism impacted the methods marginalized authors use to create forms for belonging and self-determination? As we think about the politics of life-writing, we will also consider feminist rhetorical and aesthetic strategies for confronting issues like trauma, disability, incarceration, motherhood, and friendship. Each student will conduct a large-scale research project focused on an author, genre, or theme of their choice. As we research the critical historical contexts for feminist memoir, we will simultaneously conduct our own creative experiments in life-writing.",

Twitter users quickly adopted the slogan, using the hashtag to celebrate everyday moments of beauty, accomplishment, and magic.  The slogan offered a contemporary iteration of an historical alignment: namely, the concept of &quot;magic&quot; with both Black people as well as &quot;blackness.&quot;  This course explores the legacy of Black magic--and black magic--through performance texts including plays, poetry, films, and novels.  We will investigate the creation of magical worlds, the discursive alignment of magic with blackness, and the contemporary manifestation of a historical phenomenon. We will cover, through lecture and discussion, the history of black magic representation as well as the relationship between magic and religion. Our goal will be to understand the impact and history of discursive alignments:  what relationship does &quot;black magic&quot; have to and for &quot;black bodies&quot;?  How do we understand a history of performance practice as being caught up in complicated legacies of suspicion, celebration, self-definition? The course will give participants a grounding in black performance texts, plays, and theoretical writings. *This course will also satisfy the TAPS department WIM requirement.*",

We then turn to the history of women healers including midwives, lay physicians, professional physicians and nurses. Finally, we examine women's illnesses and their treatment as well as the lives of women with disabilities in the past. We will examine differences in women's experience with medicine on the basis of race, ethnicity, sexuality and class.

This course examines his classic novels and essays as well his exciting work across many lesser-examined domains - poetry, music, theatre, sermon, photo-text, children's literature, public media, comedy and artistic collaboration. Placing his work in context with other writers of the 20C (Faulkner, Wright, Morrison) and capitalizing on a resurgence of interest in the writer (NYC just dedicated a year of celebration of Baldwin and there are 2 new journals dedicated to study of Baldwin), the course seeks to capture the power and influence of Baldwin's work during the Civil Rights era as well as his relevance in the &quot;post-race&quot; transnational 21st century, when his prescient questioning of the boundaries of race, sex, love, leadership and country assume new urgency.",

        "description": "Ballet dancers drag a long and conservative history with them each time they step onstage. Yet recently some of the most radical challenges in dance are coming from ballerinas, featuring prosthetic limbs, non-female identifying dancers en pointe, and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish women performing classical repertoire. This seminar uses dance history to reposition ballet as a daring future-facing art form, one where the politics of nationality, religion, class, gender, race, and disability intersect. These issues are provocatively illuminated by classically trained dancers like South African artist Dada Masilo in her gender-bending Swan Lake and Giselle adaptations, Phil Chan's anti-Orientalist restagings, and activist American dancer Alice Sheppard's showcasing of the art of disability partnered by her wheelchair. What can ballet bring to the pressing social issues of equity, inclusion, and diversity when for centuries it has been considered an exemplar of the static imperialist, Western art form and idealized white body? What has shifted to reveal ballet as a vital medium for registering new global identities and social justice challenges? How can an art form built on obedient bodies be politically dangerous?  Exposing limitations of binaries such as masculine/feminine, White/Black, heterosexual/homosexual, and colonial/ colonized histories, we consider how culture is complicated through the ballet repertoire and its techniques for disciplining and gendering bodies. Using live and recorded performances, interviews with practitioners reshaping the field, and close readings of new scholarship, we will see how 21st century politics are being negotiated through ballet in an intersectional frame.",

But since 2016, and in the long aftermath of Hillary Clinton's defeat to Donald Trump, anti-feminist backlash in media and politics has taken on a distinct 21st-century character, mixing old arguments with new scapegoats and adopting stylistic postures that blend open male supremacy with disavowing irony. Examining changes in popular opinion and the evolution of anti-feminist arguments on issues from abortion, to sexual violence, to trans rights, this course will map the new terrain of gender conservatism, and trace its intellectual origins in previous cycles of social progress and retrenchment.

The goal is to obtain a philosophical background that will allow us to analyze and understand the philosophical foundations of different political feminist movements. First, we will read about what is the relationship between biological sex and gender; what is the relationship between gender and other forms of identity, e.g., race, class, sexual orientation, etc.; what issues arise when we consider our standard conceptions of knowledge, scientific inquiry, and rationality from the standpoint of oppression as women (any other gender identity). In the second part of the course, we will read about what constitutes oppression, how does it arise, and why women became oppressed; how our ethical and political theories should change to reflect feminist concerns about the status of women in modern society not limiting the latter to only feminist concerns and movements in affluent countries. We will read about feminist movements in Latina America, indigenous feminist movements, and India.",

In the inordinately difficult years of 2020-2021 as the pandemic has uncovered even more lethal created divisions via closed crossings and early deaths reflecting difference, our task in this course is to both examine how systemic inequities have been developed as part of American history and our daily life, especially as we see the pandemic effects, and to see how American artists, including novelists, poets, visual and performance artists, filmmakers, photographers and essayists, have developed approaches to examine, resist or re-create how the shards of our fractured identities may make sense to us. Films from Raoul Peck on colonialism and white supremacy in this America, Barry Jenkins and Kara Walker on slavery in visual narratives, poets Shailja Patel, Naomi Shihab Nye, Claudia Rankine, Layli Long Soldier, Janice Lobo Sapiago, Felicia Zamora, Zhenyu Yuan, from within the power of multiple languages, and Ta-Nehisi Coates and Nikole Hannah-Jones of the '1619' Project who bring US education into the story, all speak to recent art and social action. Nearby guest speakers from the newly produced Mini Museum Honoring the Black Panther Party in West Oakland, and creators of the Stanford Graphic Novel Project's visual art book with revelations on California prison conditions will also provide more vivid examples for all. Students' work for the quarter includes both written analysis and creative final projects.",

How have literary traditions of madness informed modern fiction's portrayals of the human mind, particularly in the context of rapidly shifting cultural frameworks about the origins and manifestations of mental illness?

Using the novels of Akwaeke Emezi, Toni Morrison, Virginia Woolf, and Leslie Marmon Silko to guide our inquiries, we'll consider inherited and new metaphors of madness in light of emerging theoretical interpretations of disability, identity, gender and trauma.",

Sometimes self-portraits are built around a positive idea, sometimes around a sense of loss; sometimes they are constructed as a shield or as a weapon, and turn into a manifesto of the self; sometimes they include a physical representation, sometimes they deny legitimacy to the body; sometimes gender or race (or both) are at the core of the identity, sometimes they are hidden; they are, however, never neutral and are always meaningful. In this class we will learn how to disentangle these multiple layers and will work on deconstructing them: we will focus on how each facet shapes and determines the representation and will appreciate the tactics and strategies used by the artists and authors in our syllabus (Frida Kahlo, Pablo Picasso, Simone de Beauvoir, Jin Min Lee, Alison Bechdel, Jhumpa Lahiri, among others).

        "description": "The internet age has coincided with the rise of new and reinvented modes of nonfiction writing by women online. The feminist first-person essay (what simply goes by &iquest;personal essay&iquest; in the business) has transformed internet writing formally, politically, and economically. The explosion innpopularity and shareability of this nonfiction subgenre has generated a host of new media and catapulted a new coterie of women writers into prominence. Which authors have exerted the most influence upon this new subgenre, how does the emergence of the first-person essay by women signify a mainstreaming of feminist dialectic, and how has this emergence been received by both a popular readership and the media establishment?nThis discussion-based course will investigate how the growth of the feminist first-person essay has promoted new publications and modes of publication. It will trace the genesis of the online personal essay genre from public journals like LiveJournal, Blogspot, and Tumblr, via its codification in online publications like The Toast, The Rumpus, Gawker, Jezebel, Guernica, The Hairpin, The Awl, and xoJane, to its eventual breakthrough into established newspapers, magazines, and traditionally published memoirs and essay collections.nWe will investigate questions like: How can the rendering of one individual's story benefit the political mandate of the collective? What is the first person&iquest;s effect, and affect, in interspersing an author&iquest;s personal experience, and what feminist potential does it contain? How does the myth of journalistic &iquest;objectivity&iquest; conflict with the presentation of the first person, and how has this objectivity myth descended from patriarchal tropes of legitimation? What do the terms &iquest;confessional&iquest; and &iquest;silence-breaking&iquest; connote? How has social media simultaneously empowered these new modes of public feminist dialogue and also exposed feminist public intellectuals to alarming levels of harassment and abuse? How successfully has the personal essay subgenre acted in de-centering hegemonic identity structures including whiteness, class privilege, and heterosexuality? What role has the feminist first-person essay played in the emergence of heavily digitized political movements including Black Lives Matter and #MeToo? What is &iquest;trauma porn&iquest;, and how does it interface with the capitalistic structures of the first-person essay economy; what problems arise when capitalism and confessionalism intersect?",

How does literature - the power of words - address, deconstruct or comfort power dynamics (during sex and between the sexes) that are usually silenced, taboo or unspeakable? Themes explored: sex and gender, sex and power, rape culture, sexual and moral taboos (incest, abortion, pornography, infanticide, lesbianism), the body as social stigma or source of meaning. Special attention given to narrative and descriptive strategies designed to avert, expose, deconstruct or account for specifically feminine experiences (rape, orgasm, pregnancy).

        "description": "Octavia Butler's novels often begin with the question, 'how am I going to survive?' In short order, they usually ask next: what is trying to kill me?' In Butler's hands, these two questions produce theories of power and resistance, anarchy and tyranny, the death of planets and the birth of species. For the Black women at the center of Butler's novels, race and gender are explicitly inseparable from these questions, naming the violent systems imposed by an antagonistic world and the imperatives which give rise to strategies of response. At this intersection, Butler explores the fiercely practical and interpersonal politics of survival that women like her have had to fashion since the birth of the modern world. And with grim clarity, Butler invents worlds capable of holding a mirror to this one, extrapolating entire systems from those daily threats which test the limits of what can be thought and known. Are 'race' and 'gender' used to categorize humanity, or are they the tools used to invent the very category of 'the human'? Is culture constrained by our biology or is 'biology' a cultural construction? Can humanity harness our collective intelligence to avert the end of the world? Or is our collective intelligence what's killing us? These novels evoke a long tradition of Black feminist community organizing and have inspired contemporary strategies of organizing in turn. And they join Black feminist cultural theorists in untangling the predicaments of the 19th-21st centuries, not flinching at apocalyptic visions of futures we have already failed to prevent. Studying both of these Black feminist traditions alongside four of Octavia Butler's novels, we ask how such strategies of knowing and doing can possibly relate to one another, and what use we can put them to in the classroom and beyond.",

        "description": "Poetry Is Not a Luxury * These places of possibility within ourselves are dark... The titles of this course are words thought and dreamed by Audre Lorde in her essay &quot;Poetry Is Not a Luxury&quot; (a version of which was first published in 1977). In this essay she writes: &quot;For within living structures defined by profit, by linear power, by institutional dehumanization, our feelings were not meant to survive. Kept around as unavoidable adjuncts or pleasant pastimes, feelings were expected to kneel to thought as women were expected to kneel to men. But women have survived. As poets. And there are no new pains. We have felt them all already. We have hidden that fact in the same place where we have hidden our power. They surface in our dreams, and it is our dreams that point the way to freedom. Those dreams are made realizable through our poems that give us the strength and courage to see, to feel, to speak, and to dare.&quot; In this course we will consider the powers, resuscitations, and strategies found in the texts of a constellation of contemporary Black poets whose work emerges out of Black feminist thought and practices. My hope is that we will together listen toward the possibilities of this work, and through experiments in reading and writing, realize some of what these texts make it possible for us to think and feel and write and be.",

For many citizens who desire a truly representative government, SCOTUS's decision predicted the collapse of democracy and endorsed White supremacy. In this course, through an examination of jurisprudential racism and misogyny, students will learn to dissect the rhetoric of the U.S. judicial branch and the barriers it constructs to equity and inclusion through caselaw and appellate Opinions. The United States of America long deprived the right to vote to men of color and women of every race, and equal access to justice including at the intersections has been an enduring fight. The history of employment law, criminal justice, access to healthcare, and more includes jurisprudence enforcing racist and misogynist U.S. policies and social dynamics. Students will learn how to read a case, scrutinize court briefings, and contextualize bias as a foundation to erect a more just, equitable, and inclusionary legal system.",

How did leading thinkers of the region conceptualize the nature of colonialism and the methods of nationalist resistance? Did nationalism represent all social classes in British India? Did it also alienate and exclude? What tactics of resistance were developed in anti-colonial movements, especially by M. K. Gandhi? Why did independence arrive with the partition of British India into two nation-states - India and Pakistan? How did the colonial legacy shape the post-colonial nation-states of South Asia? In this this introductory lecture-based survey course on the history of modern South Asia, we will explore the answers to these questions. The course will span the period from the beginning of the nineteenth to the middle of the twentieth century, and cover the regions that constitute present day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. No prior knowledge of South Asia is necessary.",

Toiling in farms, plantations, workshops, mines, factories, brothels and households, workers seldom leave behind an account of their lives in their own words. How have labor historians devised methods and techniques of reading traces from the past of those who were on the margins of society and struggling for their survival, and dignity? In this undergraduate colloquium, we will engage with these questions, particularly through the historical scholarship on workers in the Global South. This course will provide an introduction to the history of the field of labor history across different parts of the world; discuss the tremendous influence of the historian E.P. Thompson in the shaping of the field; explore how studies of gender, race, caste, cultural identities, and of a global perspective, have transformed the field in profound ways; and how the modern world was built on the foundation of oppressive regimes of labor extraction such as slavery, indenture, and wage labor.",

Since then, women's sports have continued to grow yet the fight for recognition and equality persists. Simply put, men's sports are more popular than women's--so much so, in fact, that people often make the hierarchical distinction between &quot;sports&quot; and &quot;women's sports.&quot; But what would it take to get more women's sports featured on ESPN or more female athletes on the cover of Sports Illustrated? And, given the well-documented corruption at the highest levels of men's sports, should such an ascent in popularity be the goal for women's sports? This course will map out and respond to the multifaceted issues that emerge when women enter the sports world. Throughout the quarter, we will explore the fight for gender equality in sports through historical, cultural, and rhetorical lenses. NOTE: Class will meet in Old Union, Room 302",

Without Queer Theory, few of the discourses around desire, power and gender identity that we take for granted on college campuses today would exist. Yet there is also a real risk that reality has left the theory behind. In this course, we will try to answer the question: What do we need queer theory for? Do we still need it? And if so, of what kind?

In this course, we will learn sociological approaches to understanding and studying gender. We will critically examine how gender structures society and reproduces inequality. To do this, we will use a multi-level approach, examining gender at the individual, interactional, and structural level. We will apply this framework to multiple areas of social life, including the self, the family, school, and work. This introductory course is designed to cover a range of topics in the sociology of gender, providing a baseline for further study. You will actively participate in class, bringing your own experiences while building your sociological imagination. Through a combination of lectures, in-class discussions, and papers, students will strengthen their academic analysis and writing skills.",

We will read a Roman gynecological manual, an ancient dating guide, the world's first harlequin romance novels, ancient pornography, early Christian martyrdom accounts, stories of female and male saints, instructions for how to best battle demons, visionary accounts, and monastic rules. These will be supplemented by modern scholarship in classics, early Christian studies, gender studies, queer studies, and the history of sexuality. The purpose of our exploration is not simply to better understand ancient views of gender and sexuality. Rather, this investigation of a society whose sexual system often seems so surprising aims to denaturalize many of our own assumptions concerning gender and sexuality. In the process, we will also examine the ways these first centuries of what eventually became the world's largest religious tradition has profoundly affected the sexual norms of our own time. The seminar assumes no prior knowledge of Judaism, Christianity, the bible, or ancient history. Undergraduates register for 200-level for 5 units. Graduate students register for 300-level for 3-5 units.",

Beginning with gendered labor practices among Native Americans, West Africans, and Europeans in the seventeenth century, this class will proceed thematically and chronologically through the early twentieth century. We will consider the deep roots of gendered labor in American history, asking how categories of race and class, freedom and enslavement, and immigration status have structured female labor. We will also examine the ways in which social transformations such as industrialization and urbanization, as well as changes in the economic, political, and sexual order shaped the experiences of laboring women. Reading secondary sources alongside a rich array of primary sources, including images and songs, we will consider the deep continuities and wrenching changes in the meanings of women's work over time.",

We will examine the relationship between state laws and kinship obligations in Sophocles's Antigone. We will trace the transnational circulation of this text and its adaptations in Gambaro's Argentinian Antigona Furiosa, and Fugard and Kani's South African The Island.  We will read Shakespeare's Othello and consider questions of racism, misogyny, and intimate partner violence, investigate the reverberations of these themes in the OJ Simpson trial, and explore its afterlife in Toni Morrison's Desdemona. We will take up questions of sexual violence via John Patrick Shanley's Doubt and Ariel Dorfman's Chilean classic, Death and the Maiden. We will examine themes of police brutality and racial vulnerability in Anna Deavere Smith's Twilight and Aleshea Harris's What to Send Up When it Goes Down. Through close readings of plays, we will explore the inter-articulation of intimacy and violence, intimidation and transgression, vengeance and forgiveness within the context of larger struggles for gender and racial justice. We will read plays in light of contemporary reckonings with the US criminal justice system: the #MeToo movement and the Black Lives Matter movement. While the former appeals to the criminal justice system to restore victims&iquest; rights, the latter urges a thorough dismantling of the carceral state. How do we understand these divergent responses to augment or abolish punitive structures? Meets WM requirement for TAPS.",

        "description": "In &quot;Woman's Art: A Manifesto&quot; (1972), the artist, performer and filmmaker Valie Export (1940) proposed the transfer of women's experience into an art context and considered the body &quot;a signal bearer of meaning and communication.&quot; In reconceptualizing and displaying &quot;the&quot; body (her body) as an aesthetic sign, Export's groundbreaking work paves the way towards questioning the concepts of a &quot;female aesthetic&quot; and a &quot;male gaze&quot; (L. Mulvey). Beginning with Export, we will discuss art informed by and coalescing with feminism(s): the recent revival of the 1970s in all-women group shows, the dialectic of feminist revolution, the breakdown of stable identities and their representations, point(s) of absorption of commodified femininities. Particular attention will be paid to German-language theory and its medial transfer into art works. For students of German Studies, readings and discussions in German are possible. Online discussions will be organized with contemporary artists and curators. Emphasis will be on: the relationship between (female?) aesthetics and (gender) politics, between private and public spheres, between housework and artwork; conceptions of identity (crises) and corporeality in visual culture and mass media; categories of the artist&acute;s self in relation to the use of media (video, photography, film, collage, installation art). This course will be taught by Professor Elena Zanichelli, a Berlin-based art historian, critic, and curator. She is junior professor for Art History and Aesthetic Theory at IKFK (Institute for Art History - Film History - Art Education) at the University of Bremen.",

How does literature - the power of words - address, deconstruct or comfort power dynamics (during sex and between the sexes) that are usually silenced, taboo or unspeakable? Themes explored: sex and gender, sex and power, rape culture, sexual and moral taboos (incest, abortion, pornography, infanticide, lesbianism), the body as social stigma or source of meaning. Special attention given to narrative and descriptive strategies designed to avert, expose, deconstruct or account for specifically feminine experiences (rape, orgasm, pregnancy).

How does women's participation in anticolonial politics and fights for equal representation in postcolonial nation-states affect our understanding of gender in South Asia today? Readings examine the creation and impact of religious personal law under British colonial rule, the role of masculinity in the British-Indian army, perspectives on religion and clothing, the interplay of rights movements and anti-colonialism, and the status of women in postcolonial India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.

We'll take a holistic approach to self-presentation that includes presenting yourself with confidence, optimizing your social media and web platform, networking effectively, writing excellent queries and pitches, avoiding the slush pile, and perhaps most importantly, persevering through the inevitable self-doubt and rejection.We will focus on distinguishing the language, topics and hooks of popular media writing from those of academic writing, learn how to target and query editors on shortform pieces (personal essays, news stories, etc.), and explore how humanists can effectively self-advocate and get paid for their work.",

We will consider the ways in which theories of performance have offered generative discursive frameworks for the study of identities, variously shaped by vectors of race, gender, sexuality, religion, class, nation, ethnicity, among others. How is identity as a social category different from identity as a unique and personal attribute of selfhood? Throughout the course we will focus on the inter-locking ways in which certain dimensions of identity become salient at particular historical conjunctures. In addition, we will consider the complex discourses of identity within transnational and historical frameworks. Readings include Robin Bernstein, Ann Pellegrini, Tavia Nyong'o, Jose Munoz, Michael Taussig, Wendy Brown, Talal Asad, Jasbir Puar, among others.

As Director of Gendered Innovations, I work with the European Commission, Wellcome Trust, the U.S. National Institutes of Health and major journals on policy to support integrating sex, gender, and intersectional analysis into the design of research. The operative question is: how can this type of analysis lead to discovery &amp; innovation while enhancing social equity and environmental sustainability? Students will read and report on new research in weekly sessions and present a paper on a topic of their choice. We welcome open and respectful discussion. This course is open to upper-level undergraduate students and to graduate students by application https://forms.gle/2KmxUUnRSG2LNNSS6. Limited to 15.",

Societal change comes only when individuals and groups speak out, perseverantly, against prevailing norms. This course examines the overlapping histories of three nineteenth-century protest movements: antislavery, womens rights, and temperance. It focuses on the arguments and tactics used by these movements to persuade Americans to oppose the status quo, and it examines the points of agreement and disagreement that arose within and among these movements. Ultimately, the course connects these past protest movements to more recent analogs, such as Black Lives Matter, ERA ratification, and marijuana legalization. Throughout the course, race, gender, and class serve as central analytical themes.",

We will pay particular attention to the relationship between sexuality and issues of gender, culture, power, and resistance. We will read a Roman gynecological manual, an ancient dating guide, the world's first harlequin romance novels, ancient pornography, early Christian martyrdom accounts, stories of female and male saints, instructions for how to best battle demons, visionary accounts, and monastic rules. These will be supplemented by modern scholarship in classics, early Christian studies, gender studies, queer studies, and the history of sexuality. The purpose of our exploration is not simply to better understand ancient views of gender and sexuality. Rather, this investigation of a society whose sexual system often seems so surprising aims to denaturalize many of our own assumptions concerning gender and sexuality. In the process, we will also examine the ways these first centuries of what eventually became the world's largest religious tradition has profoundly affected the sexual norms of our own time. The seminar assumes no prior knowledge of Judaism, Christianity, the bible, or ancient history. Undergraduates register for 200-level for 5 units.

How does literature - the power of words - address, deconstruct or comfort power dynamics (during sex and between the sexes) that are usually silenced, taboo or unspeakable? Themes explored: sex and gender, sex and power, rape culture, sexual and moral taboos (incest, abortion, pornography, infanticide, lesbianism), the body as social stigma or source of meaning. Special attention given to narrative and descriptive strategies designed to avert, expose, deconstruct or account for specifically feminine experiences (rape, orgasm, pregnancy). Authors include Nobel Prize Annie Ernaux, Virginie Despentes, Marie Darrieusecq, Christine Angot, Marie NDiaye, Leonora Miano, Leila Slimani, Vanessa Springora along with feminist theory.

To do this we explore the intellectual lineage of intersectional thought from its Black Feminist roots and trace it through its use today in education research. Within these tracings, we will delve into the (mis)uses, contestations, and iterations of intersectionality in theory and empirical research. At the heart of this course is an examination of how perceptions of and beliefs about a myriad of intertwining inequities conspire to create vectors of oppressions that land in multiply &quot;marginalized students&quot; lives through the macrosociolpolitcal to the microinteractional. It interrogates the foundational ideological assumptions around culture, difference, deficit, and dis/ability in which education has traditionally been rooted. Students in the course will analyze the lineage and processes of intersectionality to understand how students at the intersections of multiple oppressions experience education within communities of practice that enact, reproduce, and resist policies and practices through their daily activities.",

        "description": "Since the emergence of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), artists have been central to the fight against the state's violence and neglect of those with HIV/AIDS. In this story, however, race and gender are marginalized as frameworks that shape this arts activism. This course takes up black art production that responds to the HIV/AIDS crisis to provide a longer, fuller, and more vital cultural narrative. By centering blackness in this story, we can ask how does dis-ease,referencing both infection and an aesthetically and structurally anxious relation to death,shape black art practices and lives? How have race and gender been used to conceptualize disease? And how do filmmakers, abstract painters, photographers, and poets help us to better comprehend blackness, gender, and sexuality under the threat of disease? After providing an overview of the relation between blackness, sexuality, and dis-ease and the emergence of the AIDS crisis, we will consider canonical works from the height of the crisis produced by filmmaker Marlon Riggs and poet Essex Hemphill. From there, we will move to themes of black art and mourning, black women's under cited activism, the controversial use of documentary photography in the crisis, black masculinity, diasporic responses, and the urgency and erasure of the ongoing crisis. Each week we will focus on a cultural text (film, painting, photograph, poem), a reading to provide historical context, and critical theories that will illuminate the art works' formal qualities and importance for our now.",
