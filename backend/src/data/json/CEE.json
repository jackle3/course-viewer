        "description": "This seminar will explore the crucial role of the Columbia River in the past, present, and future of the Pacific Northwest. Topics will include the lives and legacies of the indigenous peoples that Lewis and Clark encountered more than two centuries ago; the historic fisheries that attracted thousands of Chinese and, later, Scandinavian workers; the New Deal&iquest;s epic dam-building initiatives beginning in the 1930s; the impact of the Manhattan Project&iquest;s plutonium bomb development at Hanford Atomic Works in WWII; and the twenty-first-century server farms dotted across the Columbia Plateau. We plan to visit with local water managers, farmers, ranchers, loggers, Native American fishermen, and energy administrators, as well as elected officials and environmental activists, to examine the hydrologic, meteorologic, and geologic bases of the river&iquest;s water and energy resources, and the practical, social, environmental, economic, and political issues surrounding their development in the Pacific Northwest region.The Columbia River and its watershed provide a revealing lens on a host of issues. A transnational, multi-state river with the largest residual populations of anadromous salmonids in the continental US, it is a major source of renewable hydroelectric power. (The Grand Coulee dam powerhouse is the largest-capacity hydropower facility in the US; nearly 50% of Oregon&iquest;s electricity generation flows from hydropower; in Washington State it&iquest;s nearly two-thirds, the highest in the nation.)  The river provides a major bulk commodity transportation link from the interior West to the sea via an elaborate system of locks. It irrigates nearly 700,000 acres of sprawling wheat ranches and fruit farms in the federally administered Columbia Basin Project. We will look at all these issues with respect to rapid climate change, ecosystem impacts, economics, and public policy.We will begin with classroom briefings on campus, in preparation for the two-week field portion of the seminar.  We plan to then travel widely throughout the Columbia basin, visiting water and energy facilities across the watershed, e.g., hydro, solar, wind, and natural gas power plants; dams and reservoirs with their powerhouses, fish passage facilities, navigation locks, and flood-mitigation systems; tribal organizations; irrigation projects; the Hanford Nuclear Reservation; and offices of regulatory agencies.  We hope to meet with relevant policy experts and public officials, along with several of the stakeholders in the basin.Over the summer students will be responsible for assigned readings from several sources, including monographs, online materials, and recent news articles.  During the trip, students will work in small groups to analyze and assess one aspect of the river&iquest;s utilization, and the challenges to responsible management going forward.  The seminar will culminate in presentations to an audience of Stanford alumni in Portland, Oregon.",

Architectural theory is primarily written, but it also incorporates drawing, photography, film, and other media.  nnOne of the distinctive features of modern and contemporary architecture is its pronounced use of theory to articulate its aims. One might argue that modern architecture is modern because of its incorporation of theory. This course focuses on those early-modern, modern, and late-modern writings that have been and remain entangled with contemporary architectural thought and design practice.  nnRather than examine the development of modern architectural theory chronologically, it is explored architectural through thematic topics. These themes enable the student to understand how certain architectural theoretical concepts endure, are transformed, and can be furthered through his/her own explorations.nCEE 32B is a crosslisting of ARTHIST 217B/417B.",

The class will analyze this idea through four topics: formal analysis, manifesto, translation, and preservation. The seminar is divided into two-week modules with each of these four concepts functioning as organizing principles. nnThe first week of each module will involve familiarizing the seminar with both the terms and rhetorical tactics of the given theme by reading and analyzing specific texts and completing a short written analysis (1-2 pages). The second week will expand upon this foundation and involve further analysis in addition to each student writing a short paper (3-4 pages) drawing on the examples discussed and their own experiences in the discipline. The goal of the seminar is for each student to be able to analyze how an architectural writing is constructed and to develop his/her skills in the construction of his/her own writing.",

Part I investigates the meaning of the word &quot;place.&quot; Additional background for understanding contemporary place making will include a critique of the history of modern place-making through an examination of modern form. Part II examines two traditional notions of place by scale: from &quot;home&quot; to &quot;the city.&quot; What elements give these conceptions of space a sense of place? To answer this question, themes such as memory, mapping, and boundary, among others, will be investigated. part III presents challenges to the traditional notions of place discussed in Part II. Topics addressed include: What does it mean to be &quot;out of place&quot;? What sense of place does a nomad have, and how is this represented? What are the &quot;non-places&quot; and how can architects design for these spaces? Part IV addresses the need to re-conceptualize contemporary space. The role of digital and cyber technologies, the construction of locality in a global world, and the in-between places that result from a world in flux are topics discussed in this section of the seminar.  nLearning goals: Specific goals include clsoe reading of texts, understanding of philosophical thinking and writing, argument under uncertainty, and developed concepts of place, space and architecture.",

The context of work in many industries is today being shaped substantially by changing workforce demographics, the pervasiveness of mobile and embedded information technologies,  hyper-connected work models on a global scale, evolving notions of health and well being, etc. nnOur public realm is changing too. People are moving to cities in greater numbers than ever before posing both challenges and opportunities related to new levels of density, sustainable resource management, resilient infrastructures, as well as new forms of civic engagement at neighborhood levels, to name but a few. These changes at an urban scale impact how and where public life happens and how it interacts with new modalities at work.nnThis course will combine research, conceptual explorations, studio design work, seminars and guest lectures to explore the impact of the changing workplace on the morphology of the city by examining these bi-coastal seats of innovation. As the creative workplace continues to evolve, how will it engage the public realm within both well-established urban frameworks such as San Francisco and Boston, and emerging suburban contexts, such as Silicon Valley?nnThe course will join graduate students from the Northeastern University School of Architecture with students from the Stanford University Architectural Design program. Students will reside primarily at their prospective universities and will travel selectively for site research, team charettes and project reviews. Project sites on both coasts will be utilized for research and studio work. This is an opportunity for students from two top universities, both situated in the epicenters of workplace change, to explore and conduct valuable research on an  issue that is changing their urban environments.",

Fundamental questions about the practice and production of architecture will be examined in this seminar that focuses on the work of Edward Durell Stone (1902-78) and specifically on his work at Stanford and in Palo Alto.  By 1955, Stone was so well established that he founded an office in Palo Alto to design the Stanford Medical Center (currently slated for destruction) and several other significant local public buildings, such as the Palo Alto Civic Center.  Through site visits to his buildings, research in the Stanford archives, and interviews with architects who worked in his office (among other strategies), students will question how architecture produced in the immediate post-WWII period is thought about historically and how and when it should be preserved.",

        "description": "This course provides an introduction to American Housing practices, spanning from the Industrial Age to the present. Students will examine a range of projects that have aspired to a range of social, economic and/or environmental visions.  While learning about housing typologies, students will also evaluate the ethical role that housing plays within society.  The course focuses on the tactical potentials of housing, whether it is to provide a strong community, solve crisis situations, integrate social services, or encourage socio-economic mixture.  Students will learn housing design principles and organizational strategies, and the impact of design on the urban environment.  They will discuss themes of shared spaces and defensible spaces; and how design can accommodate the evolving demographics and culture of this country. For example, how can housing design address the changing relationship between living and working?  What is the role of housing and ownership in economic mobility? These issues will be discussed within the context the changing composition of the American population and economy.  n nThis course will be primarily discussion-based, using slideshows, readings and field trips as a departure points for student-generated conversations. Each student will be asked to lead a class discussion based on his/her research topic. Students will evaluate projects, identifying which aspects of the initial housing visions were realized, which did not, and why.  Eventually, students might identify factors that lead to &iquest;successful&iquest; projects, and/or formulate new approaches that can strengthen or redefine the progressive role of housing: one inclusive of the complex social, economic, and ethical dimensions of design.",

        "description": "Preference to Architectural Design majors. As we stare down statistics that depict whole industries, political bodies, and rooms of-influence as dominated by primarily cis-gendered white men, we choose not to lose faith, but dare to ask, 'how would our world look, feel, and function if it were built by women?' This course is meant not as an historical survey of the objective accomplishments of female architects but as a future-facing call-to-action to envision a world built by women and gender-expansive people. What might our built environments look and feel like with bold, creative women at the helm? How might we celebrate and honor more diverse and brilliant perspectives in architecture across a broad gender spectrum? How might we demand greater space for women in architecture to lead an industry into its next era? And how might we support a rising generation of young women poised to build the world they want to see? Combining topical discussions, case studies, personal reflections, charrette exercises, and a culminating design/build experience at Girls Garage, this course will inspire students of all genders to draw from the lessons of women in architecture and imagine a built environment that represents us all.",

This seminar introduces the theory, design, and application of wind energy technologies. The study of wind energy spans across a wide range of fields. To successfully deploy wind energy and other alternative technologies, we will need to converge across many knowledge domains, including civil, environmental, electrical, and mechanical engineering in addition to social science and public policy, among many others. Through this interdisciplinary course, we will learn about modern wind energy and its origins. We will explore the many facets of wind energy, including the characteristics of regional wind; aerodynamics, mechanics, and structural dynamics of wind turbine design; wind turbine control and integration with electrical systems; and environmental and economic aspects and impacts. Although this seminar seeks to explain wind energy, the topics covered can be applied to many other problems in engineering. This course will provide an introduction on how to find solutions to multi-disciplinary problems. True innovation lies on the border between fields. In this course, we will explore how to make these solutions a reality.",

You will explore answers to this question by learning about, discussing and debating urban water conflicts including the Flint water crisis, the drought in South Africa, intermittent water supply in Mumbai, and arsenic contamination in Bangladesh.  In this course, you will explore the technical, economic, institutional, social, policy, and legal aspects of urban water using these and more water conflicts as case studies. You will attend  lectures, and participate in discussions, laboratory modules, and field work. In lectures, you will learn about the link between water and human and ecosystem health, drinking water and wastewater treatment methods, as well as policies and guidelines (local, national, and global from the World Health Organization) on water and wastewater, and the role of various stakeholders including institutions and the public, in the outcome of water conflicts. You will dive into details of conflicts over water through case studies using discussion and debate. You will have  the opportunity to measure water contaminants in a laboratory module. You will sample a local stream and measure concentrations of Escherichia coli and enterococci bacteria in the water. A field trip to a local wastewater treatment plant will allow you to see how a plant operates. By the end of this course, you will have a greater appreciation of the importance of institutions, stakeholders and human behavior in the outcome of water conflicts, and the complexity of the coupled human-ecosystem-urban water system.",

Energy is also a fundamental driver of human development and opportunity. In taking this course, students will not only understand the fundamentals of each energy resource - including significance and potential, conversion processes and technologies, drivers and barriers, policy and regulation, and social, economic, and environmental impacts - students will also be able to put this in the context of the broader energy system. Both depletable and renewable energy resources are covered, including oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear, biomass and biofuel, hydroelectric, wind, solar thermal and photovoltaics (PV), geothermal, and ocean energy, with cross-cutting topics including electricity, storage, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), sustainability, green buildings, energy efficiency, transportation, and the developing world. The 4 unit course includes lecture and in-class discussion, readings and videos, homework assignments, one on-campus field trip during lecture time and two off-campus field trips with brief report assignments. Off-campus field trips to wind farms, solar farms, nuclear power plants, natural gas power plants, hydroelectric dams, etc. Enroll for 5 units to also attend the Workshop, an interactive discussion section on cross-cutting topics that meets once per week for 80 minutes (Mondays, 12:30 PM - 1:50 PM).

        "description": "Be part of a unique course about extreme energy efficiency and integrative design! We will meet once a week throughout the quarter. E^3 will focus on efficiency techniques' design, performance, integration, barrier-busting, profitable business-led implementation, and implications for energy supply, competitive success, environment, development, security, etc. Examples will span very diverse sectors, applications, issues, and disciplines, covering different energy themes throughout the quarter: buildings, transportation, industry, and implementation and implications, including renewable energy synergy and integration. The course will be composed of keynote lectures, exercises, and interactive puzzlers, synthesizing integrative design principles. Exercises will illuminate real-world design challenges RMI has faced, in which students will explore clean-sheet solutions that meet end-use demands and optimize whole-system resource efficiency, seeking expanding rather than diminishing returns to investments, i.e. making big savings cheaper than small ones. Students will work closely and interactively with the instructors Amory Lovins, cofounder and Chief Scientist of Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), Dr. Joel Swisher, former RMI managing director and Stanford instructor in CEE, more recently director of the Institute for Energy Studies at Western Washington University, and Dr. Holmes Hummel, founder of Clean Energy Works. All backgrounds and disciplines, undergraduate and graduate, are welcome to enroll. There is no application this year. Solid technical grounding and acquaintance with basic economics and business concepts will be helpful. Prerequisite - completion of one of the following courses or their equivalent is required: CEE 107A/207A/ Earthsys 103, CEE 107S/ CEE 207S, CEE 176A, CEE 176B.

        "description": "(Formerly GEOLSCI 118Y and 218Y) The complex urban problems affecting quality of life in the Bay Area, from housing affordability and transportation congestion to economic vitality and social justice, are already perceived by many to be intractable, and will likely be exacerbated by climate change and other emerging environmental and technological forces. Reforming urban systems to improve the equity, resilience and sustainability of communities will require new collaborative methods of assessment, goal setting, and problem solving across governments, markets, and communities. It will also require academic institutions to develop new models of co-production of knowledge across research, education, and practice. This XYZ course series is designed to immerse students in co-production for social change. The course sequence covers scientific research and ethical reasoning, skillsets in data-driven and qualitative analysis, and practical experience working with local partners on urban challenges that can empower students to drive responsible systems change in their future careers. The Autumn (X) and Winter (Y) courses are focused on basic and advanced skills, respectively, and completion is a prerequisite for participation in the Spring (Z) practicum quarter, which engages teams in real-world projects with Bay Area local governments or community groups. X and Y are composed of four weekly pedagogical components: (A) lectures; (B) writing prompts linked with small group discussion; (C) lab and self-guided tutorials on the R programming language; and (D) R data analysis assignments. Open to undergraduate and graduate students in any major. For more information, visit http://bay.stanford.edu/education. Cardinal Course certified by the Haas Center.

To the extent that other departments or programs contribute to the acquisition and maintenance of computers and related equipment, students from these programs will also have access for educational needs.  The cluster is not intended as a resource to support sponsored research projects, since (a) some of the software licenses (e.g., Matlab) specify limit the applications to teaching activities, and (b) the facility is the only one of its kind that is available to provide a computing intensive resource for classroom teaching and course projects.",

Through readings, seminar discussions, guest speakers, and a final project, we will explore how a smart city can leverage technology for a higher quality of life, less inequality in access to services, and tighter human communities. You will come away with a framework for understanding how to maximize the social good of emerging technologies. Course material is appropriate for students from all disciplines.

        "description": "This new class offers an exciting variation on the 'individual project' studio format. Students work as a team to propose a single consensus solution to a real-world design challenge. This collaborative studio experience more closely reflects the creative process in the design and planning professions where a group of individuals works together to brainstorm, shape, develop, and illustrate a community design solution. There are a number of benefits to this team-oriented approach: it is a more nurturing environment for students that do not have design backgrounds, it allows for more peer-to-peer learning, and it takes best advantage of varied student skill sets. But perhaps the greatest benefit is that a team of students working together on a common project will be able to develop a more comprehensive solution than any one student working alone. This means that the class &quot;deliverable&quot; at the end of quarter could be detailed enough to be of significant value to a stakeholder or client group from the larger community. This studio class, working under the guidance of an experienced instructor, functions like a design firm in providing professional-grade deliverables to real-world community design &quot;clients'.",

More than just an assembly of materials to form an enclosure, the building envelope determines the thermal comfort, energy consumption (and production), structural expression, qualities of light and material experience of a space. These parameters will be explored through the observation, documentation, and analysis of building envelopes, with a focus on sustainability.",

Through on location painting and studio sessions, students build creative capacities and develop critical thinking skills as we focus on the fundamentals of painting, discuss precedents from art and architectural history, and engage in constructive group critiques. Color theory, as it relates to value and applies to light on form and material, is examined and put into practice as students mix paint and explore a variety of techniques. Volume is a major component as we apply principles of proportion, perspective, and depth to convincingly articulate spatial relationships. Composition and design principles are investigated throughout the painting process, from preparatory graphite sketches through project completion. Active painting is enhanced by focused exercises, demonstrations, slide lectures, readings, and museum visits, all which facilitate a deeper understanding of architecture via painting.

        "description": "Cities and urban areas have always been transformed by major external changes like pandemics and public health crises. California is both in the midst of its greatest economic recession since the Great Depression and experiencing a pandemic that has the potential to reshape many aspects of life. Planning for cities and regions, however, is a long game that requires follow-through on decisions made sometimes over many decades. How do we balance the shocks to our assumptions from the current Covid world with the need to plan long-term for issues like affordable housing and equitable cities, and perhaps most fundamentally, prepare our cities and communities for the inevitability of climate change and climate impact? nnnnThis course takes an interdisciplinary view of the key contemporary planning topics in California. It does so from looking at the intersection of climate laws, land use changes, the need for housing, travel patterns and the availability of high quality jobs and employment. This course will give you an understanding of the roles of key levels of government, from the state to the region/metropolitan scale, to the city and county, down to the neighborhood and parcel level. it will give students insight into leading themes and issues of the day in California such as the future of downtowns, the role of high speed rail, the impact of telework, automation in the construction of housing, drawing from examples in San Jose and San Francisco, the Central Valley, the state legislature, Southern California. Within each of these topics we will look at the impact of decisions on equity as well as climate and the economy. nnnnThe instructors are Kristy Wang, formerly SPUR&iquest;s Community Planning Policy Director, and Egon Terplan, Senior Advisor for Economic Development and Transportation in the California Governor&iquest;s Office, formerly SPUR&iquest;s Regional Planning Director.

Circular economy provides a framework for systems-level redesign.  It builds on schools of thought including regenerative design, performance economy industrial ecology, blue economy, biomimicry, and cradle to cradle. This course introduces the concepts of the circular economy and applies them to case studies of consumer products, household goods, and fixed assets.n  nStudents will conduct independent projects on circular economy.

        "description": "The built environment enables access to economic and social mobility, however access to such systems is not uniform across communities. This creates infrastructure inequity. Climate change threatens to exacerbate existing inequities in interdependent infrastructure systems such as energy, transportation, air, and water/wastewater to name a few. The engineer of tomorrow must understand the inequities in the system and the policies that produced them in order to develop robust and innovative approaches to design and manage future systems. This course will introduce students to the prominent theories of equity and environmental justice with a focus on implementation for infrastructure. Students will learn the limitations of decontextualized technical engineering solutions and their impacts on society. Upon completion of the course, students will understand how to abstract and develop models that incorporate elements of equity and justice in civil engineering systems. This course is designed to prepare next generation engineers for careers in which they will participate in projects that directly affect historically marginalized communities.Who can take the course: It is going to be a graduate course, so students should have completed an engineering degree OR are in their final year of their degreePrerequisites: There are no pre-requisites, however familiarity with engineered systems is expected",

        "description": "Engineering Economics is a subset of the field of economics that draws upon the logic of economics, but adds that analytical power of mathematics and statistics.  The concepts developed in this course are broadly applicable to many professional and personal decisions, including making purchasing decisions, deciding between project alternatives, evaluating different processes, and balancing environmental and social costs against economic costs.  The concepts taught in this course will be increasingly valuable as students climb the carrier ladder in private industry, a non-governmental organization, a public agency, or in founding their own startup.  Eventually, the ability to make informed decisions that are based in fundamental analysis of alternatives is a part of every career.  As such, this course is recommended for engineering and non-engineering students alike. This course is taught exclusively online in every quarter it is offered.  (Prerequisites:  MATH 19 or 20 or approved equivalent.)",

        "description": "How did early Greeks, Romans, Jews, and Christians imagine space? How did they construct heaven and hell and the afterlife through their written texts? Can we take written images of the earthly and heavenly Jerusalem and her temple, such as those found in Ezekiel, the Book of Revelation and the Apocalypse of Paul and transform them into three-dimensional space? Can we visualize Homer's Hades or Dante's Inferno? We are going to try! We will meet in the architecture studio and build out of foam board and hot glue. A number of themes will emerge through the course: the interpretive move in rendering a once real space as a literary icon, the relationship between text and imagined space, the connection between space and ritual, and how to construct an image of a society from whom it imagines in hell.

The goal of this course is to learn the foundations of ecological modeling with a specific (but not exclusive) focus on marine conservation and sustainable exploitation of renewable resources. Students will be introduced to a range of methods - from basic to advanced - to characterize population structure, conduct demographic analyses, estimate extinction risk, identify temporal trends and spatial patterns, quantify the effect of environmental determinants and anthropogenic pressures on the dynamics of marine populations, describe the potential for adaptation to climate change. This course will emphasize learning by doing, and will rely heavily on practical computer laboratories, in R and/or Phyton, based on data from our own research activities or peer reviewed publications. Students with a background knowledge of statistics, programming and calculus will be most welcome. Formally BIOHOPK 143H and 243H.",

The class examines the question of how to achieve the optimal equilibrium between water supply and water demand, under specific local and regional physical environmental, social and economic constraints. Basic water management principles are reviewed in the context of sustainable development, increasing water scarcity in many parts of the world, and hydrologic uncertainty including that associated with climate change. Specific topics include the management of operations and water quality in reservoirs, river basins, and groundwater systems; non-conventional water sources such as treated wastewater and desalination; demand management options; and the institutional and legal framework of water management.",

        "description": "This interdisciplinary course integrates the legal, scientific, and policy dimensions of how we characterize and manage resource use and allocation along the California coast. We will use this geographic setting as the vehicle for exploring more generally how agencies, legislatures, and courts resolve resource-use conflicts and the role that scientific information and uncertainty play in the process. Our focus will be on the land-sea interface as we explore contemporary coastal land-use and marine resource decision-making, including coastal pollution, public health, ecosystem management; public access; private development; local community and state infrastructure; natural systems and significant threats; resource extraction; and conservation, mitigation and restoration. Students will learn the fundamental physics, chemistry, and biology of the coastal zone, tools for exploring data collected in the coastal ocean, and the institutional framework that shapes public and private decisions affecting coastal resources. There will be 3 to 4 written assignments addressing policy and science issues during the quarter, as well as a take-home final assignment. Special Instructions: In-class work and discussion is often done in interdisciplinary teams of students from the School of Law, the School of Engineering, the School of Humanities and Sciences, and the School of Earth, Energy, and Environmental Sciences. Students are expected to participate in class discussion and field trips. Elements used in grading: Participation, including class session and field trip attendance, writing and quantitative assignments. Cross-listed with Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering (CEE 175A/275A), Earth Systems (EARTHSYS 175/275), and Law (LAW 2510). Open to graduate students and to advanced undergraduates with instructor consent. Enrollment limited; priority given to CEE  majors and Law School students.",

Despite having one of the world's most comprehensive environmental laws and regulations, China was among the most polluted globally until recent years.  The Eighteenth Party Congress in November 2012 was a watershed event in China's environmental and ecological landscape.  However, strong central directives to clean up the environment and curb carbon emissions have yielded mixed results.  From the angle of environmental governance, this course examines how domestic actors and institutions affect policy making and implementation in China from the late twentieth century until today.  It draws upon analytical frameworks from the disciplines of the social sciences to explain policy outputs and outcomes.",

These challenges are found at both ends of the pipe: the need to supply usable water of adequate quality for a rapidly growing human population, and the need to prevent pollution and diseases from wastewater discharge. In this hybrid virtual and in person, comprehensive, and interdisciplinary course, top researchers from Israel's Ben-Gurion University of the Negev partner with experts from Yale University, Northwestern University (USA), and Stanford to discuss pressing water issues and present innovative solutions and technologies for treating wastewater and ensuring safe reuse, mitigating water shortage globally, and reversing pollution of surface and subsurface water. The course provides a thorough introduction discovering the newest technologies being developed at the forefront of research: Recovering nutrients from wastewater for use as fertilizers in agriculture, desalination of brackish groundwater, soil aquifer treatment (SAT), recirculated vertical flow constructed wetland (RVFCW), and more. We will review these technologies from an engineering perspective as well as the physical, chemical and biological processes involved. We will also see (via video) these technologies in use in several systems in Israel.",

        "description": "Be part of a unique course about extreme energy efficiency and integrative design! We will meet once a week throughout the quarter. E^3 will focus on efficiency techniques' design, performance, integration, barrier-busting, profitable business-led implementation, and implications for energy supply, competitive success, environment, development, security, etc. Examples will span very diverse sectors, applications, issues, and disciplines, covering different energy themes throughout the quarter: buildings, transportation, industry, and implementation and implications, including renewable energy synergy and integration. The course will be composed of keynote lectures, exercises, and interactive puzzlers, synthesizing integrative design principles. Exercises will illuminate real-world design challenges RMI has faced, in which students will explore clean-sheet solutions that meet end-use demands and optimize whole-system resource efficiency, seeking expanding rather than diminishing returns to investments, i.e. making big savings cheaper than small ones. Students will work closely and interactively with the instructors Amory Lovins, cofounder and Chief Scientist of Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), Dr. Joel Swisher, former RMI managing director and Stanford instructor in CEE, more recently director of the Institute for Energy Studies at Western Washington University, and Dr. Holmes Hummel, founder of Clean Energy Works. All backgrounds and disciplines, undergraduate and graduate, are welcome to enroll. There is no application this year. Solid technical grounding and acquaintance with basic economics and business concepts will be helpful.

        "description": "Energy is the number one contributor to climate change and has significant consequences for our society, political system, economy, and environment. Energy is also a fundamental driver of human development and opportunity. Students will learn the fundamentals of each energy resource -- including significance and potential, drivers and barriers, policy and regulation, and social, economic, and environmental impacts -- and will be able to put this in the context of the broader energy system. Both depletable and renewable energy resources are covered, including oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear, biomass and biofuel, hydroelectric, wind, solar thermal and photovoltaics (PV), geothermal, and ocean energy, with cross-cutting topics including electricity, storage, hydrogen, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), sustainability, green buildings, energy efficiency, transportation, and the developing world. The course is 3 units, which includes lecture, readings and videos, and homework assignments. This is a course for all: pre-majors and majors, with any background - no prior energy knowledge necessary. For a course that covers all of this plus goes more in-depth, check out CEE 107A/207A - ENERGY 107A/207A - EarthSys 103 Understand Energy offered in the autumn and spring quarters (students should not take both for credit).

        "description": "Clients: Asian Pacific Environmental Network (APEN) as well as legislative and California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) decision makers. Buildings play a central role in protecting us from extreme climate events and in governing our consumption of energy via the natural gas and electric system. It is in our buildings, especially our homes, that climate resilience and climate mitigation meet. But at present, these conversations -- about the policy pathways to greater climate resilience and options for faster building decarbonization -- are largely conducted separately. The goal of Buildings in the Energy Transition is to develop policy analyses that optimize for affordability, resilience and mitigation, incorporating energy modelling, public health and energy regulatory perspectives. We will conduct our work from the perspective of and informed by the needs of our client, APEN, an environmental justice organization that is actively involved in resilience and decarbonization policy. In this course, students will learn the basics of key policy areas related to buildings including resilience to heat and smoke, building electrification, net energy metering (NEM), and customer bill affordability programs. Lectures will focus on technical, economic and legal aspects of the challenge. In addition, students will work in groups on legal and regulatory analysis aimed at supporting better decision making on buildings policy in both California and the Northeast. Students will work in partnership with postdocs and legal fellows on their group projects and may have the opportunity to present the results of their work to both APEN and CPUC staff. The course is intended for students interested in multi-disciplinary approaches to public policy problems. No background in either energy law or energy modelling is required. Students will engage in weekly lecture and discussion of building resilience and decarbonization science and policy, including student presentations and guest lectures by scientists, practitioners and policymakers. Students will also meet additionally once per week with Professors Sivas and Wara in working sessions to discuss progress on team projects. Elements used in grading: Attendance, Performance, Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Paper. CONSENT APPLICATION: To apply for this course, students must complete and submit a Consent Application Form available at https://law.stanford.edu/education/courses/consent-of-instructor-forms/.

        "description": "(Formerly GEOLSCI 118Y and 218Y) The complex urban problems affecting quality of life in the Bay Area, from housing affordability and transportation congestion to economic vitality and social justice, are already perceived by many to be intractable, and will likely be exacerbated by climate change and other emerging environmental and technological forces. Reforming urban systems to improve the equity, resilience and sustainability of communities will require new collaborative methods of assessment, goal setting, and problem solving across governments, markets, and communities. It will also require academic institutions to develop new models of co-production of knowledge across research, education, and practice. This XYZ course series is designed to immerse students in co-production for social change. The course sequence covers scientific research and ethical reasoning, skillsets in data-driven and qualitative analysis, and practical experience working with local partners on urban challenges that can empower students to drive responsible systems change in their future careers. The Autumn (X) and Winter (Y) courses are focused on basic and advanced skills, respectively, and completion is a prerequisite for participation in the Spring (Z) practicum quarter, which engages teams in real-world projects with Bay Area local governments or community groups. X and Y are composed of four weekly pedagogical components: (A) lectures; (B) writing prompts linked with small group discussion; (C) lab and self-guided tutorials on the R programming language; and (D) R data analysis assignments. Open to undergraduate and graduate students in any major. For more information, visit http://bay.stanford.edu/education. Cardinal Course certified by the Haas Center.

To the extent that other departments or programs contribute to the acquisition and maintenance of computers and related equipment, students from these programs will also have access for educational needs.  The cluster is not intended as a resource to support sponsored research projects, since (a) some of the software licenses (e.g., Matlab) specify limit the applications to teaching activities, and (b) the facility is the only one of its kind that is available to provide a computing intensive resource for classroom teaching and course projects.

        "description": "Cities and urban areas have always been transformed by major external changes like pandemics and public health crises. California is both in the midst of its greatest economic recession since the Great Depression and experiencing a pandemic that has the potential to reshape many aspects of life. Planning for cities and regions, however, is a long game that requires follow-through on decisions made sometimes over many decades. How do we balance the shocks to our assumptions from the current Covid world with the need to plan long-term for issues like affordable housing and equitable cities, and perhaps most fundamentally, prepare our cities and communities for the inevitability of climate change and climate impact? nnnnThis course takes an interdisciplinary view of the key contemporary planning topics in California. It does so from looking at the intersection of climate laws, land use changes, the need for housing, travel patterns and the availability of high quality jobs and employment. This course will give you an understanding of the roles of key levels of government, from the state to the region/metropolitan scale, to the city and county, down to the neighborhood and parcel level. it will give students insight into leading themes and issues of the day in California such as the future of downtowns, the role of high speed rail, the impact of telework, automation in the construction of housing, drawing from examples in San Jose and San Francisco, the Central Valley, the state legislature, Southern California. Within each of these topics we will look at the impact of decisions on equity as well as climate and the economy. nnnnThe instructors are Kristy Wang, formerly SPUR&iquest;s Community Planning Policy Director, and Egon Terplan, Senior Advisor for Economic Development and Transportation in the California Governor&iquest;s Office, formerly SPUR&iquest;s Regional Planning Director.

Climate change threatens to exacerbate existing inequities in interdependent infrastructure systems such as energy, transportation, air, and water/wastewater to name a few. The engineer of tomorrow must understand the inequities in the system and the policies that produced them in order to develop robust and innovative approaches to design and manage future systems. This course will introduce students to the prominent theories of equity and environmental justice with a focus on implementation for infrastructure. Students will learn the limitations of decontextualized technical engineering solutions and their impacts on society. Upon completion of the course, students will understand how to abstract and develop models that incorporate elements of equity and justice in civil engineering systems. This course is designed to prepare next generation engineers for careers in which they will participate in projects that directly affect historically marginalized communities.Who can take the course: It is going to be a graduate course, so students should have completed an engineering degree OR are in their final year of their degreePrerequisites: There are no pre-requisites, however familiarity with engineered systems is expected",

        "description": "This course will offer students an introduction to Real Estate Development.  Senior Principals from Sares Regis, a regional commercial and residential real estate development company, will cover topics on all aspects of the development process.  Guest speakers from the fields of architecture and engineering, finance and marketing will participate in some of the classes.  They will offer the students a window into the world of how houses, apartments, office buildings and public facilities are conceived of, brought through the design and approval process, financed, marketed and then sold and/or rented.  There will be nine 1.5-hour lectures (robust class discussion encouraged). Throughout the quarter, the students will work on a group case study assignment about one local project that is currently being built or was recently completed.  This assignment will be due in the form of a presentation during the final exam period.  No prior knowledge of real estate is required.  Classes commence on April 6 and complete on June 1.  Number of students is limited to 30.  Undergraduates must apply by submitting a one-page essay explaining their interest in taking the class to mradyk@srgnc.com by March 20, 2023.",

Climate change adaptations are adjustments in behaviors, plans and projects to reduce society's vulnerability to climate change impacts. Major adaptation approaches relevant to civil and environmental engineers are emphasized. Adaptation measures considered include structural and ecologically-based measures for dealing with sea level rise, storm surges, floods and wildfires. In the context of coastal flooding, consideration is also given to &iquest;managed retreat&iquest; (i.e., deliberately altering flood defenses to allow flooding of presently protected areas). Influence of climate change on migration is also considered. Additional measures to reduce vulnerability include emergency preparedness and disaster response management systems. Illustrations of innovative adaptation measures taken by cities around the world are featured. Common barriers to climate change adaptation are also reviewed. Limited enrollment. Students from all departments and programs are welcome, with some admission preference given to students in CEE graduate programs followed by CEE Department seniors.",

        "description": "Adaptation to climate change will not only require new infrastructure and policies, but it will also challenge our local, state and national governments to collaborate across jurisdictional lines in ways that include many different types of private and nonprofit organizations and individual actors. The course explores what it means for communities to be resilient and how they can reach that goal in an equitable and effective way. Using wildfires in California as a case study, the course assesses specific strategies, such as controlled burns and building codes, and a range of planning and policy measures that can be used to enhance climate resilience. In addition, it considers how climate change and development of forested exurban areas (among other factors) have influenced the size and severity of wildfires. The course also examines the obstacles communities face in selecting and implementing adaptation measures (e.g., resource constraints, incentives to develop in forested areas, inadequate policy enforcement, and weak inter-agency coordination). Officials from various Bay Area organizations contribute to aspects of the course; and students will present final papers to local government offcials. Limited enrollment. Students will be asked to prepare application essays on the first day of class. Course is intended for seniors and graduate students.",

At the same time, the causal pathways that link infrastructure and economic development are not well understood, and are likely being re-shaped by a changing climate. Students in this course will contribute to a new initiative on poverty, infrastructure and climate change by (1) reviewing and synthesizing literature from relevant scholarly communities, (2) co-creating a conceptual causal model of the ways in which infrastructure (particularly roads and water assets) contributes to poverty alleviation, and (3) contributing to the design of applied research effort on these topics in sub-Saharan Africa. Students who opt for the 3-unit enrollment will have an additional supervised project that could take the form of a review paper, research proposal, or analysis of secondary data.

        "description": "This seminar series focuses on the dramatic changes in recent decades in California water policy and management and how water researchers can help forge modern, collaborative solutions that will allow the state to adapt to an uncertain and challenging future. The seminar will meet six times during the Spring Quarter. The heart of the series will include four seminars with panels of outside experts covering the following topics: 1) The diversification of California's water supply portfolio; 2) The rise of the coequal goals of ecosystem restoration and water supply reliability; 3) The ongoing tension between collaborative and adversarial decision-making processes; and 4) Implications for water researchers seeking to help define pathways to meaningful solutions. In addition to these four seminar sessions, there will be an introductory California Water 101 session for students and a closing session on what we have learned. Students will be assigned readings and required to develop questions for discussion. Lead instructor for the seminar will be Landreth Visiting Fellow Dr. Timothy Quinn. Dr. Quinn spent more than ten years as the executive director of the Association of California Water Agencies, and more than twenty years as the Deputy General Manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Over the course of that career, he was at the center of every major water management issue facing the state of California, including the state's use of Colorado River water, management of the Bay Delta, and sustainable groundwater management. This class will meet the first five weeks of the quarter. Elements used in grading: Attendance, Class Participation, Written Assignments. Cross-listed with Law 2521.",

First, students should develop the ability to derive mass balance equations used to quantify the fate of chemicals in the environment. With so many chemicals having been introduced in the past ~60 years, many of the key parameters needed for mass balance models have not been measured experimentally. The class builds on CEE 270, which developed methods of predicting equilibrium partitioning coefficients. For many situations involving reactions of target contaminants, equilibrium is not attained. The course develops methods of predicting the reactivity of chemicals based upon their chemical structures both qualitatively and quantitatively. natural reaction processes covered include acid-base speciation, nucleophilic substitution, oxidation/reduction reactions, and photochemical reactions. Key treatment ractions (ozone, UV treatment and advanced oxidation) are also covered.  Prerequisites: CEE 270, Chem 31B/M.",

While societies struggle to manage waste, natural environmental cycles reuse any 'waste' product as starting material elsewhere. Polluted water threatens aquatic ecosystems and exacerbates water scarcity, which a majority of people globally will experience by 2030. Discharging wastewater is an unaffordable luxury for a world facing climate change and resource scarcity. Reframing waste streams as sources of raw materials motivates the design of selective materials and processes capable of converting water pollutants into valuable products. Electrochemical separations exhibit several benefits for wastewater treatment, including their modularity, substitution of chemical inputs with electricity, and fine-tune control over interfacial phenomena. In this course, students will learn the fundamental principles and design rules for electrochemical materials and processes for next-generation water treatment. Assignments will focus on critically reviewing electrochemical water treatment literature, evaluating applications for removing pollutants and creating products from aqueous streams, and contrasting various approaches to address water pollution. Throughout the course, students will build towards final projects proposing novel materials or processes for electrochemical water treatment.",

        "title": "The Business of Water",
        "description": "Freshwater is our most crucial natural resource, but it is facing mounting pressures from climate change and other factors.  While public agencies traditionally dominated water management, private water companies are playing an increasingly important (and sometime controversial) role. In many cases, private companies are making critical contributions to meeting societal water needs (e.g., by developing new technologies and finding new ways to reduce water use).  In other cases, however, the involvement of private companies has proven controversial (e.g., when private companies have taken over public water supply systems in developing countries such as Bolivia). This course will look at established and emerging businesses in the water sector and the legal, economic, and social issues generated by the private sector's involvement. These businesses include water technology companies (e.g., companies commercializing new desalination or water recycling technologies), venture capitalists, water funds (that directly buy and sell water rights), consulting firms, innovative agricultural companies, and large corporations (that increasingly are adopting corporate stewardship programs).  The course will begin with two weeks of introduction to water and the private water sector.  After that, each class will focus on a different water company. Company executives will attend each class session and discuss their business with the class. In most classes, we will examine (1) the viability and efficacy of the company's business plan, (2) the legal and/or social issues arising from the business' work, and (3) how the business might contribute to improved water management and policy. Each student will be expected to write (1) two short reflection papers on businesses that visit the class, and (2) a 10- to15-page paper at the conclusion of the class on an idea that the student has for a new water company, on an existing water company of the student's choice, or on a legal or policy initiative that can improve the role that business plays in improving water management (either in a particular sector or more generally). This course is open to graduate students from around the campus.  Elements used in grading: Attendance, Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Paper. Cross-listed with Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering (CEE 273B).",

        "description": "This course explores the technological innovations required to support a circular water economy in which nontraditional water is treated to fit-for-purpose standards and reused locally. The first part of this course reviews the key constituents present in nontraditional source waters and the state-of-the-art pretreatment, desalination, and concentrate disposal technologies for their removal. Attention is given to the thermodynamic and operational barriers to improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of current technologies. The second part of this course identifies opportunities for next generation autonomous, precise, resilient, process-intensified, modular, and electrically powered desalination alternatives to lower the cost and energy intensity of water reuse. Over the duration of the course, students will form teams to perform an in-depth review of a single nontraditional source water treatment train, research the state-of-technology relative to that required for reuse, and perform a quantitative estimate of life cycle capex and opex costs.Course Structure: This course combines a lecture-based introduction to critical material with extensive in-class discussion of daily readings from the peer reviewed literature. As such, it is designed for graduate students across the university with comfort reading the academic literature, a solid knowledge of physicochemical processes, and a basic understanding of traditional water treatment technologies. Assessment elements will include class participation, in class presentations, and a final project report. Enrollment limited to 20.",

We will use this geographic setting as the vehicle for exploring more generally how agencies, legislatures, and courts resolve resource-use conflicts and the role that scientific information and uncertainty play in the process. Our focus will be on the land-sea interface as we explore contemporary coastal land-use and marine resource decision-making, including coastal pollution, public health, ecosystem management; public access; private development; local community and state infrastructure; natural systems and significant threats; resource extraction; and conservation, mitigation and restoration. Students will learn the fundamental physics, chemistry, and biology of the coastal zone, tools for exploring data collected in the coastal ocean, and the institutional framework that shapes public and private decisions affecting coastal resources. There will be 3 to 4 written assignments addressing policy and science issues during the quarter, as well as a take-home final assignment. Special Instructions: In-class work and discussion is often done in interdisciplinary teams of students from the School of Law, the School of Engineering, the School of Humanities and Sciences, and the School of Earth, Energy, and Environmental Sciences. Students are expected to participate in class discussion and field trips. Elements used in grading: Participation, including class session and field trip attendance, writing and quantitative assignments. Cross-listed with Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering (CEE 175A/275A), Earth Systems (EARTHSYS 175/275), and Law (LAW 2510).

        "description": "Environmental policy formation is a complex process involving a large number of actors making value laden interpretations of scientifically complex phenomena. This course explores the origins of this complexity and its implications for the future of environmental decision making and policy-directed environmental engineering. We will begin by asking what good environmental policy looks like, including how we set policy for groups of individuals with diverse preferences, how we value preferences across space and time, and how we account for the deep uncertainty that permeates environmental systems. We then turn to how environmental policies are actually developed, exploring the technical, cognitive, organizational, and systemic barriers to implementing &iquest;good&iquest; policy. Finally, will explore the role of scientific evidence in shaping environmental policy and the mechanisms by which policy shapes engineering and science research. Students will gain familiarity with the existing theories, methods, and strategies used to set environmental policy; critically examine the embedded assumptions and inherent shortcomings of these approaches; and practice their thoughtful and ethical application to timely environmental challenges. Course Structure: This course combines a lecture-based introduction to critical material with extensive in-class discussion of daily readings from the policy analysis canon. As such, it is designed for PhD and Masters students across the university with an interest in exploring the effective role of science in setting public policy and comfort in reading primary literature. Upper level undergraduates are welcome with instructor consent. Assessment elements will include class participation, responses on 4 to 5 written assignments, and a take-home final. Occasional Friday recitation sessions will provide guidance on the application of policy analysis methods,",

        "description": "Over three decades of extraordinary economic development in China came at the tremendous expense of the environment.  Despite having one of the world's most comprehensive environmental laws and regulations, China was among the most polluted globally until recent years.  The Eighteenth Party Congress in November 2012 was a watershed event in China's environmental and ecological landscape.  However, strong central directives to clean up the environment and curb carbon emissions have yielded mixed results.  From the angle of environmental governance, this course examines how domestic actors and institutions affect policy making and implementation in China from the late twentieth century until today.  It draws upon analytical frameworks from the disciplines of the social sciences to explain policy outputs and outcomes.",

The first half of the course will focus on building computational tools for simulation of earthquake shaking, damage to buildings and infrastructure, and the resulting social and economic losses. The second half of the course will explore how impact modeling relates to disaster recovery policy, infrastructure investment planning, and other aspects of disaster risk management. The class will include guest speakers from government institutions, private sector, and academia who work at the intersection of risk modeling and planning/policy. The students will also conduct a regional seismic risk analysis tailored to a specific risk management objective, as part of a final project. Prerequisited:  CEE 288.",

These systems include Energy, Transportation, Communication, Water, Air, Ecosystem and Geophysical systems. The class introduces basics of current infrastructure systems and explores in greater depth how these systems can be integrated in design and in operations. Students taking this course will develop a framework for understanding integrated infrastructure design from multiple engineering and civic perspectives. Specific topics include: - Boundaries and boundary conditions between built and natural infrastructure systems - quantifying and normalizing materials and energy flows between built and natural urban systems - basis of physical, economic, and legal control of infrastructure systems. When appropriate, students will be able to develop new metrics to evaluate single system and integrated system performance.",

        "description": "Pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations, and other beneficial institutional investors control more than $100 trillion in investable assets. These funds may be beneficial in nature, they exist to secure a promised social benefit, but they are also the base of our modern capitalist system. They are responsible for funding industries that Stanford students will seek to work in (or with), such as venture capital, hedge funds, private equity, or other professional investors. As such, if we are to unlock financial capital to fund meaningful solutions to societies problems, such as climate change, these investors must allocate capital to these projects. But few people understand why these organizations exist, how they operate or invest, and what the implications of their decisions are for society and the planet. This course aims to equip the Stanford community with a deep understanding of beneficial institutional investors. The course will be given in a seminar format and be broken down into three modules: 1) Why beneficial investors exist; 2) How they invest their capital; and 3) How their investing affects the sustainability of modern capitalism.",

        "description": "Policymakers rely on quantitative systems models to inform decision-making about environmental policy design, infrastructure development, and resource allocation. However, many rapid, transformational changes in the climate and socioeconomic systems are difficult to predict and quantify in models. Therefore, reliance on traditional model-based decision analysis can leave policymakers vulnerable to unforeseen risks. In this class, students will learn quantitative methods for addressing deep uncertainties using systems modeling, enabling them to identify potential vulnerabilities and design decision policies that are robust and resilient to a wide range of uncertain futures. Drawing on tools in simulation, optimization, and machine learning, specific methods include: exploratory modeling, scenario discovery, robust decision making, and adaptation pathways. We will demonstrate these approaches in a range of sustainability domains such as water resources, agriculture, and energy systems. Students will complete Python-based modeling assignments, read contemporary journal articles, and develop a research proposal.  Prerequisites: Prior coursework in applied optimization (e.g. CEE 266G or MS&amp;E 211); and prior coursework in decision or policy analysis (e.g. CEE 275D or MS&amp;E 250A or MS&amp;E 252); and proficiency in Python programming at the level of CME 193",

Today, the world has changed as a result of the global pandemic caused by this virus, and every 3 year old can say &quot;coronavirus&quot;. In this course, we will explore how research filled critical knowledge gaps related to environmental fate and transport of viruses allowed us to better understand the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and inform public health policies on masking and social distancing. We will also discuss the flow of scientific discoveries and knowledge from laboratory to the public during the pandemic and how typical outlets for dissemination of science were or were not effective during the crisis. This course will involve substantial reading of the peer-reviewed and popular literature, and lively discussions and debate.  Course likely will be offered remote synchronous",
