When safety or balance in the water is in question, so is the ability to move, and to some extent, the ability to breathe comfortably.  As comfort and balance improves, the easier it is to accept breathing and movement skills. The goal is for a swimmer to become comfortable and in control in both shallow and deep water. The fundamental skills learned in this course will provide a foundation for learning stroke technique, such as freestyle, in an effortless manner. Prerequisites: None",

The last 3 weeks will have both mounted and unmounted portions of class. The mounted portion of class focuses on learning correct position while riding at the walk, proper use of the aids to communicate with the horse, as well as balance and strength-building exercises. This course will utilize class discussion, assignments, and student participation to develop each student into a rider who can work with a horse both mounted and unmounted at an introductory level. English and Western styles of riding will be offered, with an emphasis on western riding.Prerequisite: All levels of rider's are welcome.",
